{"text": "Semantic segmentation is a critical task in computer vision, enabling precise pixel-level understanding of images. However, existing methods often struggle with computational inefficiency and suboptimal performance in complex scenes. This paper introduces *Attend and Segment*, a novel framework that leverages attention mechanisms to guide active semantic segmentation. The proposed approach dynamically focuses computational resources on the most informative regions of an image, significantly reducing redundant processing while maintaining high accuracy. Our method integrates a lightweight attention module with a state-of-the-art segmentation network, enabling adaptive feature extraction and efficient inference. Experiments on benchmark datasets, including Cityscapes and PASCAL VOC, demonstrate that *Attend and Segment* achieves competitive segmentation accuracy while reducing computational overhead by up to 40% compared to traditional methods. The framework also exhibits robustness in handling occlusions and varying scene complexities. By combining attention-guided active learning with semantic segmentation, this work advances the state of the art in efficient and accurate scene understanding, with potential applications in autonomous driving, robotics, and medical imaging.  \n\n**Keywords**: semantic segmentation, attention mechanisms, active learning, computer vision, computational efficiency."}

{"text": "Reinforcement Learning (RL) has shown remarkable success in various domains, particularly in continuous control tasks. However, a significant challenge lies in ensuring robustness to action perturbations, which can severely degrade performance in real-world applications. This paper addresses the problem of action robustness in RL by proposing a novel framework, Action Robust Reinforcement Learning (AR-RL), designed to enhance the resilience of policies to uncertainties and disturbances in action execution. Our approach integrates a robust optimization technique with deep RL algorithms, enabling the learned policies to account for potential action deviations during training. We evaluate AR-RL on a suite of continuous control benchmarks, including simulated robotic tasks, and demonstrate its superior performance compared to standard RL methods under various levels of action noise. Results show that AR-RL achieves higher task success rates and stability, even in the presence of significant perturbations. The proposed framework not only advances the theoretical understanding of robustness in RL but also offers practical implications for deploying RL-based systems in real-world environments where action uncertainties are inevitable. Key contributions include a scalable training methodology, empirical validation across diverse tasks, and insights into the trade-offs between robustness and performance. This work paves the way for more reliable and adaptable RL systems in safety-critical applications.  \n\n**Keywords**: Reinforcement Learning, Robust Optimization, Continuous Control, Action Perturbations, Deep RL, Robotics."}

The objective is to enable robust and scalable integration of heterogeneous datasets, which is critical for applications such as multi-omics analysis, social network modeling, and large-scale sensor data fusion. We introduce a unified approach that leverages the inherent dependencies within and across multiple layers of data, combining statistical estimation with efficient computational techniques. Our method employs a hierarchical Bayesian framework to model the joint structure of multi-layered GGMs, enabling simultaneous estimation of intra-layer and inter-layer dependencies. Through extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets, we demonstrate that the proposed approach outperforms existing methods in terms of accuracy, scalability, and interpretability. Key findings include improved precision in dependency estimation and enhanced robustness to noise and missing data. The framework also provides a principled way to infer global patterns from integrated datasets, offering valuable insights for decision-making in complex systems. This work contributes to the growing field of data integration by providing a scalable and statistically rigorous solution, with potential applications in bioinformatics, network analysis, and beyond.  \n\n**Keywords**: Gaussian Graphical Models, data integration, multi-layered networks, Bayesian inference, dependency estimation, scalable algorithms."}

The proposed approach transforms raw sensor data into BEV images, capturing spatial and temporal interactions between vehicles in a unified framework. A CNN-based model is then employed to process these representations, enabling the prediction of future trajectories with high precision. The model is trained and evaluated on a large-scale dataset of real-world highway driving scenarios, demonstrating superior performance compared to traditional methods. Key findings reveal that the BEV representation significantly improves the model\u2019s ability to capture complex vehicle interactions, achieving state-of-the-art accuracy in trajectory prediction. The results highlight the potential of this approach for real-time applications in autonomous driving systems, offering a robust solution for navigating dynamic and crowded environments. This research contributes to the field by introducing a novel integration of BEV representations and CNNs, paving the way for more reliable and scalable trajectory prediction systems.  \n\n**Keywords**: Vehicle trajectory prediction, Bird\u2019s Eye View, Convolutional Neural Networks, autonomous driving, highway scenarios."}

{"text": "Reinforcement Learning (RL) often faces challenges in environments with multiple optimal policies, where traditional methods may struggle to explore and converge effectively. This paper introduces **POMO (Policy Optimization with Multiple Optima)**, a novel RL framework designed to address these challenges by leveraging multiple optima during policy optimization. The proposed approach integrates a multi-objective optimization strategy that simultaneously explores diverse optimal policies, enhancing exploration efficiency and robustness in complex environments. POMO employs a dynamic weighting mechanism to balance exploration and exploitation, ensuring convergence to high-performing policies while maintaining diversity. Experiments conducted on benchmark RL environments demonstrate that POMO outperforms existing methods in terms of policy diversity, convergence speed, and overall performance. The framework is particularly effective in scenarios with sparse rewards or high-dimensional action spaces, where traditional RL algorithms often underperform. The results highlight POMO's potential for applications in robotics, autonomous systems, and other domains requiring adaptive decision-making. This work contributes to the RL field by providing a scalable and efficient solution for environments with multiple optima, paving the way for more robust and versatile RL systems.  \n\n**Keywords**: Reinforcement Learning, Policy Optimization, Multiple Optima, Exploration-Exploitation, Multi-Objective Optimization, Adaptive Decision-Making."}

This paper proposes a novel framework that unifies GCNs and LP, addressing their individual limitations and combining their strengths. The proposed method integrates the feature-learning capabilities of GCNs with the label-smoothing properties of LP, enabling more robust and accurate predictions on semi-supervised node classification tasks.

{"text": "Action anticipation from first-person video is a critical task in computer vision, with applications in robotics, surveillance, and human-computer interaction. This paper introduces a novel approach leveraging Rolling-Unrolling Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks to predict future actions by analyzing temporal dynamics in egocentric video sequences. The proposed method employs a dual-phase architecture: the *rolling* phase processes past video frames to capture contextual information, while the *unrolling* phase generates predictions for future actions. By integrating spatial and temporal features, the model effectively bridges the gap between observed and anticipated events. Experiments conducted on benchmark datasets demonstrate that the Rolling-Unrolling LSTM outperforms existing methods in terms of accuracy and computational efficiency. Key findings reveal significant improvements in early action prediction, particularly in complex, real-world scenarios. The results highlight the model's ability to generalize across diverse environments and action categories. This research contributes a robust framework for action anticipation, offering potential applications in autonomous systems and real-time decision-making.

{"text": "Reinforcement Learning (RL) systems often struggle with out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization, where agents fail to perform effectively in environments that differ significantly from their training data. This paper addresses this critical challenge by proposing a novel representation learning framework designed to enhance OOD generalization in RL. Our approach leverages self-supervised learning techniques to extract robust and transferable features from high-dimensional input spaces, enabling agents to adapt to unseen environments more effectively. We introduce a multi-task training paradigm that encourages the learning of invariant representations, reducing sensitivity to distributional shifts. Experiments conducted on a suite of benchmark environments demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing baselines in OOD scenarios, achieving up to a 30% improvement in performance metrics. Furthermore, we provide a theoretical analysis of the framework, highlighting its ability to disentangle task-relevant features from spurious correlations. The results underscore the potential of our approach to advance the deployment of RL systems in real-world applications, where environmental variability is a common challenge. This work contributes to the growing body of research on robust RL by offering a scalable and practical solution for improving generalization capabilities.  \n\n**Keywords**: Reinforcement Learning, Out-Of-Distribution Generalization, Representation Learning, Self-Supervised Learning, Multi-Task Learning, Robust AI."}

{"text": "Reinforcement Learning (RL) has shown remarkable success in various domains, but its performance often hinges on the quality of training data and exploration strategies. This paper introduces *CoachNet*, a novel adversarial sampling approach designed to enhance the efficiency and robustness of RL algorithms. The primary objective of CoachNet is to address the challenge of suboptimal exploration by generating adversarial samples that guide the agent toward more informative and challenging states during training. The proposed method leverages a dual-network architecture, where one network acts as the RL agent and the other as an adversarial coach, dynamically generating samples to push the agent beyond its current capabilities.  \n\nExperiments conducted on benchmark environments, including OpenAI Gym and Atari games, demonstrate that CoachNet significantly improves learning efficiency and final performance compared to traditional exploration strategies. The results highlight the method's ability to accelerate convergence and achieve higher rewards, particularly in complex and sparse-reward scenarios. Furthermore, CoachNet exhibits robustness to varying environmental dynamics, making it a versatile tool for real-world RL applications.  \n\nThe key contribution of this work lies in its innovative adversarial sampling framework, which not only enhances exploration but also provides a scalable solution for improving RL training. This approach opens new avenues for developing more efficient and adaptive RL systems, with potential applications in robotics, autonomous systems, and game AI.  \n\n**Keywords**: Reinforcement Learning, Adversarial Sampling, Exploration Strategies, CoachNet, Robust Learning, AI Training."}

{"text": "Emotion perception from human gaits has gained significant attention in recent years due to its potential applications in human-computer interaction, healthcare, and security. This paper introduces STEP (Spatial Temporal Graph Convolutional Networks for Emotion Perception), a novel framework designed to accurately recognize emotions from gait patterns by leveraging spatial and temporal dependencies. Unlike traditional approaches that rely on handcrafted features or isolated spatial or temporal modeling, STEP integrates graph convolutional networks (GCNs) with temporal modeling techniques to capture the intricate relationships between body joints and their dynamic changes over time. The proposed model processes gait data as a sequence of skeletal graphs, where nodes represent body joints and edges encode spatial connections, while temporal convolutions model the evolution of these graphs across frames. Experiments conducted on benchmark datasets demonstrate that STEP outperforms existing methods in emotion recognition accuracy, achieving state-of-the-art results. The framework also exhibits robustness to variations in gait speed and viewpoint. The findings highlight the effectiveness of combining spatial and temporal graph-based representations for emotion perception, offering a promising direction for future research in affective computing and gait analysis. Key contributions include the novel integration of spatial-temporal graph convolutions and the demonstration of their superiority in emotion recognition tasks.

{"text": "This paper addresses the challenge of fitting nonconvex penalized generalized linear models (GLMs) with grouped predictors, a problem commonly encountered in high-dimensional data analysis. Traditional convex penalties often fail to achieve both sparsity and unbiasedness simultaneously, while nonconvex penalties offer a promising alternative. However, their optimization remains computationally challenging due to nonconvexity and grouping constraints. We propose an iterative algorithm that efficiently solves this problem by leveraging a combination of proximal gradient descent and group-wise coordinate updates. The algorithm is designed to handle grouped predictors, ensuring that variables within the same group are either selected or excluded collectively, thereby preserving the interpretability of the model. Experimental results on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that our approach outperforms existing methods in terms of both computational efficiency and model accuracy. Specifically, the proposed algorithm achieves superior sparsity recovery and prediction performance while maintaining robustness to noise. The findings highlight the practical utility of our method in applications such as genomics, where grouped predictors are prevalent. This work contributes to the field by providing a scalable and effective solution for fitting nonconvex penalized GLMs with grouped predictors, offering significant improvements over conventional approaches.  \n\n**Keywords**: nonconvex penalties, generalized linear models, grouped predictors, iterative algorithm, high-dimensional data, sparsity, proximal gradient descent."}

{"text": "Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) has shown remarkable success in various domains, but its reliance on extensive reward signals and exploration efficiency remains a significant challenge. This paper introduces a novel approach, Variational Dynamic for Self-Supervised Exploration (VDSSE), to address these limitations. The proposed method leverages variational inference to model the dynamics of the environment, enabling agents to autonomously generate intrinsic rewards for exploration without explicit external guidance. By integrating a self-supervised learning framework, VDSSE encourages agents to discover novel states and improve sample efficiency. We evaluate our approach on a suite of benchmark environments, including complex control tasks and sparse-reward scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate that VDSSE outperforms existing exploration strategies in terms of cumulative rewards and convergence speed. Furthermore, the method exhibits robustness in high-dimensional and partially observable environments. The key contribution of this work lies in its ability to combine variational dynamics with self-supervised learning, offering a scalable and efficient solution for exploration in DRL. This research opens new avenues for applying DRL in real-world applications where reward signals are scarce or costly to obtain.  \n\n**Keywords**: Deep Reinforcement Learning, Variational Inference, Self-Supervised Learning, Exploration, Intrinsic Rewards, Sample Efficiency."}
{"text": "Neural network pruning is a widely adopted technique to reduce model complexity and computational overhead, but it often introduces unintended biases that degrade model fairness and performance. This paper investigates the impact of pruning on bias amplification in neural networks and proposes a novel approach to mitigate these effects using knowledge distillation. We evaluate the bias introduced by various pruning techniques across multiple datasets and architectures, focusing on fairness metrics such as demographic parity and equalized odds. Our method leverages knowledge distillation to transfer knowledge from a robust, unpruned teacher model to a pruned student model, ensuring that the pruned network retains fairness while maintaining accuracy. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach significantly reduces bias in pruned models compared to traditional pruning methods, achieving a balance between model efficiency and fairness. The findings highlight the importance of addressing bias in resource-constrained environments and provide a practical framework for deploying fair and efficient neural networks. Key contributions include a comprehensive evaluation of pruning-induced bias and a distillation-based mitigation strategy that advances the state-of-the-art in fair model compression.  \n\n**Keywords**: Neural network pruning, knowledge distillation, bias mitigation, fairness, model compression, AI ethics."}

Traditional MOT methods often struggle with occlusions, complex object interactions, and scalability in 3D space. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel framework leveraging Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to model the relationships between objects and their trajectories over time. Our approach constructs a spatio-temporal graph where nodes represent detected objects and edges encode their spatial and temporal dependencies. By incorporating attention mechanisms, the model dynamically prioritizes relevant interactions, improving tracking accuracy in cluttered scenes. We evaluate our method on benchmark datasets, demonstrating superior performance in terms of tracking precision and robustness compared to state-of-the-art techniques. The results highlight the effectiveness of GNNs in capturing complex object dynamics and handling occlusions. This work contributes a scalable and interpretable solution for 3D MOT, with potential applications in autonomous navigation, surveillance, and augmented reality. Key innovations include the integration of attention-based GNNs and a unified framework for object detection and tracking.

{"text": "This paper addresses the challenge of learning optimal policies in continuous state and action Markov Decision Processes (MDPs), a critical problem in reinforcement learning with applications in robotics, control systems, and autonomous decision-making. Traditional methods often struggle with scalability and computational efficiency in high-dimensional continuous spaces. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel randomized policy learning framework that leverages stochastic optimization techniques and function approximation. Our approach combines randomized exploration strategies with gradient-based policy updates, enabling efficient exploration of the state-action space while maintaining convergence guarantees. We evaluate the proposed method on benchmark continuous control tasks and demonstrate its superior performance in terms of sample efficiency and policy quality compared to existing state-of-the-art algorithms. The results highlight the framework's ability to handle complex, high-dimensional environments effectively. This work contributes a scalable and practical solution for continuous MDPs, with potential applications in real-world systems requiring adaptive and robust decision-making.  \n\n**Keywords**: Reinforcement learning, continuous MDPs, randomized policy learning, stochastic optimization, function approximation, autonomous decision-making."}

The objective is to enable rapid and accurate optimization of complex 3D structures, which is critical for applications in additive manufacturing, aerospace, and automotive design. We propose a deep neural network (DNN) architecture trained on a diverse dataset of pre-optimized 3D topologies, leveraging transfer learning to adapt the model to new design constraints and material properties. The method combines convolutional neural networks (CNNs) with generative adversarial networks (GANs) to predict optimal material distributions while maintaining structural integrity. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves a 90% reduction in computation time compared to conventional finite element analysis (FEA)-based methods, with comparable or superior performance in terms of stress distribution and compliance. The model also generalizes effectively across varying geometries and loading conditions, showcasing its robustness. This research contributes a scalable and efficient solution for real-time topology optimization, with significant implications for industries requiring rapid prototyping and design iteration. Key innovations include the integration of transfer learning to enhance adaptability and the use of generative models to improve prediction accuracy.

{"text": "Skeleton-based action recognition has gained significant attention due to its robustness and efficiency in representing human motion. However, the adversarial vulnerability of these systems remains underexplored, posing potential risks in real-world applications such as surveillance and human-computer interaction. This study investigates the susceptibility of skeleton-based action recognition models to adversarial attacks, aiming to identify critical weaknesses and propose mitigation strategies. We employ a systematic approach, leveraging state-of-the-art adversarial attack techniques, including gradient-based and optimization-based methods, to evaluate the robustness of widely used models such as Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs). Our experiments reveal that even subtle perturbations to skeleton data can significantly degrade model performance, highlighting the inherent vulnerability of these systems. Furthermore, we introduce a novel defense mechanism that enhances model resilience by incorporating adversarial training and data augmentation techniques. The results demonstrate a notable improvement in robustness without compromising accuracy on clean data. This research provides valuable insights into the adversarial vulnerabilities of skeleton-based action recognition and offers practical solutions to enhance the security of such systems in critical applications.  \n\n**Keywords**: Skeleton-based action recognition, adversarial attacks, Graph Convolutional Networks, robustness, adversarial training, human motion analysis."}

The proposed method leverages the Gi* statistic to identify and emphasize spatially significant features, enabling the model to adapt to varying spatial structures in overhead imagery. We evaluate our approach on multiple benchmark datasets, including high-resolution satellite and aerial imagery, and demonstrate significant improvements in segmentation accuracy compared to traditional pooling methods. The results show that Getis-Ord Gi* pooling enhances the model's ability to capture contextual information and generalize across different geographic regions.

This paper introduces a novel attention-based model for clinical time series analysis, aiming to improve the accuracy and interpretability of disease diagnosis and patient outcome prediction. The proposed approach leverages multi-head self-attention mechanisms to capture long-range dependencies and temporal patterns in EHRs, enabling the model to focus on clinically relevant time steps and features.

{"text": "Scene Graph Generation (SGG) is a critical task in computer vision, aiming to model the relationships between objects in an image as a structured graph. However, existing approaches often treat relation labels as flat categories, overlooking their inherent hierarchical structure, which can lead to suboptimal performance. This paper explores the hierarchical nature of relation labels in SGG and proposes a novel framework to leverage this hierarchy for improved relation prediction. Our approach introduces a hierarchical classification model that captures the dependencies and semantic relationships between different levels of relation labels, from coarse-grained to fine-grained. We evaluate our method on benchmark datasets, demonstrating significant improvements in relation prediction accuracy compared to state-of-the-art flat-label approaches. Additionally, our framework enhances interpretability by providing insights into the hierarchical structure of relations. The results highlight the importance of incorporating hierarchical information in SGG and open new avenues for research in structured visual understanding. Key contributions include a scalable hierarchical model, improved performance metrics, and a deeper understanding of relation label semantics. This work has implications for applications such as image captioning, visual question answering, and autonomous systems, where accurate and interpretable scene understanding is crucial.  \n\n**Keywords**: Scene Graph Generation, Hierarchical Classification, Relation Prediction, Computer Vision, Structured Visual Understanding."}

The objective is to develop an efficient and scalable framework capable of capturing complex dependencies within large-scale datasets while maintaining computational tractability. We propose a novel TT-based architecture that leverages low-rank tensor decompositions to reduce the number of parameters and computational overhead, enabling efficient learning and inference.

The objective of this research is to address the challenge of generating high-quality visual outputs from sparse, structural wireframe inputs, which is critical for applications in computer graphics, 3D reconstruction, and augmented reality. The proposed approach leverages a conditional generative adversarial network (cGAN) architecture, enhanced with a multi-scale feature extraction module and a perceptual loss function to ensure both structural accuracy and visual fidelity. The model is trained on a diverse dataset of wireframe-image pairs, enabling it to learn complex mappings between geometric structures and textured surfaces.

{"text": "Object detection systems are critical components in various applications, including autonomous vehicles and surveillance. However, their vulnerability to adversarial attacks remains a significant concern. This paper introduces the concept of *Contextual Camouflage Attack (CCA)*, a novel adversarial strategy designed to exploit the contextual dependencies in object detection models. Unlike traditional attacks that focus on pixel-level perturbations, CCA leverages contextual information to create camouflage patterns that blend seamlessly with the environment, making objects undetectable by state-of-the-art detectors.  \n\nWe propose a systematic framework for generating contextual camouflage patterns using a generative adversarial network (GAN) trained on diverse environmental contexts. The attack is evaluated on multiple object detection benchmarks, including YOLOv5 and Faster R-CNN, demonstrating a significant reduction in detection accuracy. Experimental results reveal that CCA achieves a 40% higher success rate compared to existing adversarial methods, while maintaining naturalistic appearances that evade human suspicion.  \n\nThe findings highlight the critical need for robust object detection systems capable of resisting context-aware adversarial manipulations. This research contributes to the field of adversarial machine learning by introducing a new attack paradigm and providing insights into potential defense mechanisms. The implications extend to real-world applications, emphasizing the importance of addressing contextual vulnerabilities in AI-driven systems.  \n\n**Keywords**: adversarial attack, object detection, contextual camouflage, GAN, robustness, machine learning."}

{"text": "Dermoscopic image segmentation plays a critical role in the early detection and diagnosis of skin lesions, yet achieving high accuracy remains challenging due to variations in lesion appearance and image quality. This paper proposes an enhanced convolutional-deconvolutional network (CDN) architecture to improve segmentation performance in dermoscopic images. The proposed model integrates multi-scale feature extraction and attention mechanisms to better capture fine-grained details and contextual information, addressing limitations in existing approaches. A hybrid loss function is introduced to optimize boundary precision and region consistency during training. Experiments were conducted on publicly available datasets, including ISIC 2018, demonstrating significant improvements in segmentation accuracy compared to state-of-the-art methods. The enhanced CDN achieves a mean Dice coefficient of 92.3%, outperforming baseline models by 3.7%. Additionally, the model exhibits robustness to noise and artifacts, making it suitable for real-world clinical applications. The findings highlight the potential of advanced deep learning techniques in medical image analysis and provide a foundation for future research in automated skin lesion diagnosis.

{"text": "This paper introduces a novel approach to integrating binary layers into deep neural networks (DNNs) by leveraging the Fast Walsh-Hadamard Transform (FWHT) and smooth-thresholding techniques. The objective is to address the computational inefficiencies and memory constraints associated with traditional binary layers, which are critical for deploying lightweight models in resource-constrained environments. The proposed method utilizes FWHT to enable efficient computation of binary operations, reducing the complexity of matrix multiplications typically required in DNNs. Additionally, smooth-thresholding is employed to approximate binary activations, ensuring differentiable training while maintaining the benefits of binary representations. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves competitive accuracy on benchmark datasets, such as CIFAR-10 and ImageNet, while significantly reducing computational overhead compared to conventional binary layers. The method also outperforms existing binary neural network techniques in terms of inference speed and memory efficiency. This work contributes to the advancement of lightweight deep learning models, offering a practical solution for edge computing and real-time applications. Key innovations include the integration of FWHT for efficient computation and the use of smooth-thresholding to enable end-to-end training of binary layers. The findings highlight the potential of this approach for deploying high-performance DNNs in low-resource settings.  \n\n**Keywords**: Fast Walsh-Hadamard Transform, binary neural networks, smooth-thresholding, lightweight models, deep learning, edge computing."}

{"text": "This paper presents a novel reinforcement learning (RL) hyper-heuristic framework designed to address multi-objective single-point search problems, with a specific application to structural fault identification in engineering systems. The objective of this research is to enhance the efficiency and accuracy of identifying structural faults by optimizing the trade-offs between conflicting objectives, such as computational cost, detection accuracy, and robustness. The proposed approach integrates a reinforcement learning mechanism with a hyper-heuristic strategy to dynamically select and adapt low-level heuristics during the search process. This adaptive capability allows the system to efficiently navigate complex solution spaces and achieve superior performance compared to traditional static heuristic methods. Experimental results demonstrate that the RL-based hyper-heuristic significantly outperforms existing techniques in terms of solution quality and convergence speed, particularly in scenarios with high-dimensional and non-linear search spaces. The findings highlight the potential of this approach for real-world applications in structural health monitoring and fault diagnosis, offering a scalable and adaptable solution for complex engineering challenges. This research contributes to the advancement of intelligent optimization techniques by introducing a reinforcement learning-driven hyper-heuristic framework tailored for multi-objective problems, paving the way for future innovations in automated fault detection and decision-making systems.  \n\n**Keywords**: reinforcement learning, hyper-heuristic, multi-objective optimization, structural fault identification, adaptive search, fault diagnosis."}

This paper addresses the challenge of achieving accurate and interactive segmentation of medical images, which is essential for real-world clinical applications. We propose a novel approach leveraging Fully Convolutional Neural Networks (FCNNs) to enhance segmentation accuracy while maintaining user interactivity. Our method integrates user inputs, such as clicks or scribbles, into the FCNN architecture, allowing the model to adapt dynamically to user guidance. The proposed system is trained on a diverse dataset of medical images, including MRI and CT scans, and evaluated against state-of-the-art segmentation techniques. Experimental results demonstrate significant improvements in segmentation precision and computational efficiency, with a mean Dice coefficient improvement of 8% compared to existing methods. Furthermore, the system achieves real-time performance, making it suitable for clinical workflows.

{"text": "Semantic part segmentation is a critical task in computer vision, enabling fine-grained understanding of object structures. However, traditional methods often require extensive labeled datasets, limiting their applicability in scenarios with limited data. This paper introduces a novel approach to one-shot semantic part segmentation by repurposing Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). We leverage the inherent feature representations learned by GANs during image generation to segment semantic parts with minimal supervision. Our method involves fine-tuning a pre-trained GAN model using a single annotated example, enabling it to generalize to unseen instances of the same object category. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach achieves competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art methods, even with significantly reduced training data. The proposed framework not only reduces the dependency on large-scale labeled datasets but also highlights the versatility of GANs beyond image synthesis. This work opens new avenues for leveraging generative models in low-data regimes, with potential applications in medical imaging, autonomous driving, and robotics.  \n\n**Keywords**: GANs, one-shot learning, semantic part segmentation, computer vision, generative models, low-data regimes."}
{"text": "Reinforcement Learning (RL) has shown significant potential in optimizing residential load control, yet its effectiveness heavily relies on the quality of state-time feature extraction. This paper proposes a novel approach leveraging Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for automatic state-time feature extraction in RL-based residential load control systems. The objective is to enhance the efficiency and adaptability of load management by capturing temporal dependencies and spatial patterns in energy consumption data. Our methodology integrates a CNN-based feature extractor with a Deep Q-Network (DQN) framework, enabling the system to autonomously learn and extract relevant features from raw time-series data. Experimental evaluations were conducted on a simulated residential energy environment, comparing the proposed CNN-based approach with traditional feature engineering methods. Results demonstrate that the CNN-enhanced RL model achieves superior performance, with a 15% improvement in load reduction efficiency and a 20% increase in adaptability to dynamic consumption patterns. The findings highlight the potential of CNNs in automating feature extraction for RL applications, reducing the need for manual feature engineering and improving scalability. This research contributes to advancing smart grid technologies by providing a robust framework for intelligent residential load control, with implications for energy efficiency and demand-side management.  \n\n**Keywords**: Convolutional Neural Networks, Reinforcement Learning, Residential Load Control, Feature Extraction, Deep Q-Network, Smart Grid, Energy Efficiency."}

{"text": "InfographicVQA addresses the growing need for automated systems capable of understanding and interpreting complex infographics, which combine visual and textual elements to convey information. The objective of this research is to develop a robust framework for Visual Question Answering (VQA) tailored specifically for infographics, enabling machines to answer questions based on their multimodal content. To achieve this, we introduce a novel dataset, InfographicVQA, comprising diverse infographics paired with question-answer annotations. We propose a hybrid deep learning model that integrates state-of-the-art vision and language processing techniques, leveraging convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for visual feature extraction and transformer-based architectures for text understanding and reasoning. Our approach emphasizes the fusion of visual and textual modalities to capture the intricate relationships within infographics. Experimental results demonstrate that our model outperforms existing VQA baselines, achieving significant improvements in accuracy and robustness. The findings highlight the importance of domain-specific adaptations in VQA systems and provide valuable insights for future research in multimodal AI. This work contributes to advancing the field of automated infographic analysis, with potential applications in education, data journalism, and business intelligence.

{"text": "This paper addresses the challenge of efficiently optimizing local policies in complex decision-making environments, where traditional methods often struggle with scalability and computational cost. We propose a novel approach that leverages Bayesian optimization (BO) to guide the search for optimal policies in high-dimensional spaces. By modeling the policy performance as a probabilistic surrogate, our method intelligently explores the parameter space, balancing exploration and exploitation to converge to high-performing solutions with fewer evaluations. The proposed framework is evaluated on a range of benchmark tasks, including robotic control and resource allocation, demonstrating significant improvements in convergence speed and solution quality compared to conventional gradient-based and random search methods. Results indicate that our approach not only reduces computational overhead but also achieves robust performance in noisy and uncertain environments.

{"text": "Deep metric learning has emerged as a powerful approach for learning discriminative feature representations, particularly in tasks such as image retrieval, clustering, and classification. However, traditional methods often rely on Euclidean embeddings, which may not fully capture the intrinsic geometric relationships in high-dimensional data. This paper introduces a novel framework for deep metric learning that leverages spherical embeddings to enhance the representation of feature spaces. By constraining embeddings to a unit hypersphere, our approach inherently normalizes feature vectors, enabling more effective similarity measurements and improved generalization. We propose a spherical loss function that optimizes angular distances, ensuring robust learning of discriminative features. Experiments conducted on benchmark datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art Euclidean-based approaches in terms of retrieval accuracy and clustering performance. The results highlight the significance of geometric constraints in metric learning and provide insights into the benefits of spherical embeddings for high-dimensional data. This work contributes to advancing deep metric learning by offering a scalable and geometrically intuitive solution with potential applications in computer vision, recommendation systems, and beyond.  \n\n**Keywords**: Deep metric learning, spherical embedding, feature representation, angular distance, hypersphere, image retrieval."}

This paper addresses the problem of debiased off-policy evaluation (OPE) in recommendation systems, aiming to provide reliable performance estimates without the need for costly online experiments. We propose a novel framework that leverages inverse propensity scoring (IPS) combined with advanced bias correction techniques to mitigate the effects of selection bias inherent in logged user interactions. Our approach integrates a robust propensity estimation model, which adapts to varying user behavior patterns, and a doubly robust estimator to enhance evaluation accuracy. Through extensive experiments on real-world datasets, we demonstrate that our method significantly reduces bias and variance compared to existing OPE techniques, achieving up to a 30% improvement in estimation accuracy. The results highlight the practical applicability of our framework in improving the reliability of offline evaluation for recommendation systems, enabling more informed decision-making in system design and deployment.

This paper investigates the vulnerability of PDPs to data poisoning attacks, where malicious actors intentionally manipulate training data to mislead model interpretations. We propose a novel framework for crafting adversarial data perturbations that systematically distort PDPs while maintaining the model's predictive accuracy. Our approach leverages gradient-based optimization techniques to identify minimal yet effective data modifications that maximize discrepancies in PDP interpretations. Experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed method, showing significant deviations in PDPs with minimal changes to the training data. Furthermore, we analyze the impact of such attacks on model trustworthiness and decision-making processes. This study highlights critical security risks in interpretable machine learning and underscores the need for robust mechanisms to safeguard against data poisoning. The findings contribute to advancing the understanding of adversarial vulnerabilities in interpretability tools and provide a foundation for developing more resilient machine learning systems.  \n\n**Keywords**: Partial Dependence Plots, data poisoning, adversarial attacks, interpretable machine learning, model robustness, gradient-based optimization."}

The proposed approach eliminates the need for manually predefined anchors, enhancing detection accuracy while maintaining computational efficiency. Experiments on benchmark datasets, including ICDAR2015 and MSRA-TD500, demonstrate that STELA achieves state-of-the-art performance with a detection speed of 45 FPS on a single GPU. Compared to existing methods, STELA improves precision by 3.2% and recall by 2.8% while reducing inference time by 20%. The results highlight the effectiveness of learned anchors in improving text localization and the framework's suitability for real-world applications. This work contributes to advancing real-time scene text detection by offering a robust, efficient, and scalable solution.  \n\n**Keywords**: Scene text detection, real-time systems, learned anchors, computer vision, neural networks."}

Experimental results demonstrate that RIFE outperforms existing methods in terms of both accuracy and speed across multiple benchmark datasets. Furthermore, its simplicity and efficiency make it highly suitable for practical applications, such as video enhancement, slow-motion generation, and real-time video processing.

{"text": "Building change detection in remote sensing images is a critical task for urban planning, disaster management, and environmental monitoring. This paper addresses the challenge of accurately identifying changes in building structures over time by proposing a novel Dual Task Constrained Deep Siamese Convolutional Network (DTC-DSCN) model. The model leverages a Siamese architecture to process multi-temporal remote sensing images, ensuring robust feature extraction and comparison. A dual-task constraint mechanism is introduced to simultaneously optimize change detection and building segmentation, enhancing the model's ability to distinguish between relevant changes and irrelevant variations such as seasonal or lighting differences. Experiments conducted on benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed DTC-DSCN achieves superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods, with significant improvements in precision, recall, and F1-score. The results highlight the model's effectiveness in handling complex urban environments and its potential for real-world applications. This research contributes to the field by introducing a unified framework that integrates multi-task learning with deep Siamese networks, offering a scalable and accurate solution for building change detection in remote sensing imagery.  \n\n**Keywords**: Building change detection, remote sensing, Siamese network, deep learning, multi-task learning, urban monitoring."}

{"text": "This paper addresses the challenge of achieving finite-time convergence in linear two-time-scale stochastic approximation (SA) algorithms, a critical problem in reinforcement learning, optimization, and control systems. Traditional SA methods often suffer from slow convergence due to the inherent coupling between fast and slow time scales. To overcome this limitation, we propose a novel restarting scheme that dynamically adjusts the learning rates and restarts the algorithm based on a carefully designed criterion. Our approach leverages a rigorous finite-time analysis framework to establish theoretical guarantees for convergence rates, ensuring improved performance compared to existing methods. Through extensive experiments on benchmark problems, we demonstrate that the proposed restarting scheme significantly accelerates convergence while maintaining stability. The results highlight the practical applicability of our method in scenarios requiring efficient and robust optimization, such as policy evaluation in reinforcement learning and large-scale machine learning tasks. This work contributes to the advancement of SA algorithms by introducing a systematic approach to enhance convergence speed and reliability, offering valuable insights for both theoretical and applied research in optimization and machine learning.  \n\n**Keywords**: Stochastic approximation, two-time-scale systems, finite-time convergence, restarting scheme, reinforcement learning, optimization."}
{"text": "Predicting the Remaining Useful Life (RUL) of industrial equipment is critical for optimizing maintenance schedules and reducing operational costs. This paper addresses the challenge of accurately estimating RUL by leveraging time series data and advanced machine learning techniques. We propose a novel approach based on Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) that utilizes time series embeddings to capture temporal dependencies and patterns in sensor data. Our method transforms raw sensor readings into low-dimensional embeddings, enabling efficient feature extraction and improving the model's ability to generalize across diverse datasets. The proposed model is evaluated on publicly available benchmark datasets, demonstrating superior performance compared to traditional methods in terms of prediction accuracy and computational efficiency. Key findings reveal that our approach achieves a significant reduction in mean absolute error (MAE) and root mean square error (RMSE) when compared to state-of-the-art techniques. The results highlight the potential of RNN-based time series embeddings for real-world applications in predictive maintenance. This research contributes to the field by introducing a scalable and interpretable framework for RUL prediction, which can be adapted to various industrial domains.

This paper introduces a generalized zero-shot learning (GZSL) framework for emotion recognition from body gestures, addressing the limitations of existing methods. The proposed framework leverages a novel multi-modal feature extraction pipeline that combines spatial-temporal representations of body movements with semantic embeddings of emotion labels. A hybrid deep learning architecture, integrating graph convolutional networks (GCNs) and transformer models, is employed to capture both local and global dependencies in gesture data. The framework is evaluated on two benchmark datasets, achieving state-of-the-art performance in both zero-shot and generalized zero-shot settings. Results demonstrate significant improvements in recognizing unseen emotions, with an average accuracy increase of 12% compared to existing methods. The proposed approach also exhibits robustness to variations in gesture styles and cultural contexts. This research contributes to advancing emotion recognition systems by enabling scalability to diverse and unseen emotional expressions, paving the way for more adaptive and inclusive human-computer interaction technologies.  \n\n**Keywords**: Emotion recognition, body gestures, zero-shot learning, graph convolutional networks, transformer models, human-computer interaction."}

{"text": "Tiny object detection remains a significant challenge in computer vision due to the limited spatial information and low resolution of such objects. This paper investigates the role of the Feature Pyramid Network (FPN) in improving detection accuracy for tiny objects by analyzing the effective fusion factor within the FPN architecture. We propose a novel approach to optimize feature fusion by dynamically adjusting the contribution of different pyramid levels based on object scale and contextual information. Our method leverages a lightweight attention mechanism to enhance the fusion process, ensuring that fine-grained details from lower-level features are effectively integrated with semantic-rich higher-level features. Experiments conducted on benchmark datasets, including COCO and Pascal VOC, demonstrate that our approach achieves a significant improvement in detection performance for tiny objects, outperforming existing FPN-based methods by 5-7% in mean Average Precision (mAP). The results highlight the importance of adaptive feature fusion in addressing the challenges of tiny object detection. This work contributes to advancing object detection systems, particularly in applications such as surveillance, medical imaging, and autonomous driving, where detecting small objects is critical.  \n\n**Keywords**: Tiny object detection, Feature Pyramid Network (FPN), feature fusion, attention mechanism, computer vision, object detection."}
{"text": "This paper addresses the challenge of unsupervised learning in the domain of artistic style analysis, focusing on the identification and representation of distinct artistic styles without labeled data. We propose a novel approach called Archetypal Style Analysis (ASA), which leverages unsupervised machine learning techniques to extract and model the fundamental stylistic elements that define various art forms. The ASA framework employs a combination of deep learning-based feature extraction and archetypal analysis to identify representative style prototypes from large, unannotated datasets of artworks. Our method is evaluated on a diverse collection of paintings spanning multiple art movements, demonstrating its ability to accurately cluster and characterize styles based on visual features. Results show that ASA outperforms traditional clustering methods in terms of style separation and interpretability, providing a robust foundation for applications such as art recommendation, style transfer, and digital art curation. The proposed approach contributes to the field by offering a scalable, unsupervised solution for artistic style analysis, reducing reliance on labeled data while maintaining high accuracy and interpretability. This research has implications for both the art and technology communities, enabling new possibilities for understanding and interacting with artistic content in digital environments.  \n\n**Keywords**: unsupervised learning, artistic style analysis, archetypal analysis, deep learning, style transfer, art recommendation."}

{"text": "This paper addresses the challenge of analyzing time-series data, specifically focusing on infant-sleep patterns, using low-rank matrix factorization (LRMF). The objective is to extract meaningful temporal patterns and reduce noise in high-dimensional datasets, enabling more accurate interpretation of sleep behaviors. We propose a novel LRMF-based approach that decomposes the time-series data into low-rank components representing underlying sleep cycles and sparse components capturing anomalies or irregularities. The method leverages iterative optimization techniques to ensure robust factorization while preserving temporal dependencies. Experimental results on real-world infant-sleep datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, achieving superior noise reduction and pattern extraction compared to traditional methods such as Fourier transforms and principal component analysis. The findings reveal distinct sleep stages and transitions, providing valuable insights for pediatric sleep research. This work contributes a scalable and interpretable framework for time-series analysis, with potential applications in healthcare monitoring, anomaly detection, and behavioral studies. Key innovations include the integration of temporal constraints into LRMF and the ability to handle noisy, incomplete datasets.

{"text": "Semi-supervised learning (SSL) has emerged as a powerful paradigm to leverage both labeled and unlabeled data for improving model performance, especially in scenarios where labeled data is scarce. This paper introduces *Pseudo-Representation Labeling Semi-Supervised Learning (PRL-SSL)*, a novel framework designed to enhance the quality of pseudo-labels in SSL by leveraging representation learning. Traditional SSL methods often rely on confidence-based pseudo-labeling, which can propagate errors due to noisy or uncertain predictions. PRL-SSL addresses this limitation by integrating representation learning to generate more reliable pseudo-labels. The proposed approach employs a dual-branch architecture: one branch focuses on learning robust feature representations, while the other generates pseudo-labels based on the learned representations. Experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that PRL-SSL outperforms state-of-the-art SSL methods, achieving significant improvements in classification accuracy, particularly in low-label regimes. The framework also exhibits strong generalization capabilities across diverse domains, including image classification and text analysis. By combining representation learning with pseudo-labeling, PRL-SSL provides a scalable and effective solution for semi-supervised tasks, offering new insights into leveraging unlabeled data for improved model performance.  \n\n**Keywords**: Semi-supervised learning, pseudo-labeling, representation learning, deep learning, classification, low-label regimes."}
{"text": "This paper explores the application of Neural Vector Autoregressions (NVARs) in forecasting, causality analysis, and impulse response estimation within time series data. Traditional Vector Autoregressive (VAR) models have been widely used for these tasks but often struggle with high-dimensional data and nonlinear relationships. To address these limitations, we propose a novel NVAR framework that leverages deep learning architectures to capture complex temporal dependencies and nonlinear dynamics. The approach integrates neural networks with autoregressive modeling, enabling more accurate predictions and robust causal inference. We evaluate the proposed method on synthetic and real-world datasets, demonstrating its superior performance in forecasting accuracy and causality detection compared to conventional VAR models. Additionally, the framework provides interpretable impulse response functions, offering insights into the dynamic interactions between variables. The results highlight the potential of NVARs as a powerful tool for time series analysis, with applications in economics, finance, and other domains requiring advanced forecasting and causal modeling.  \n\n**Keywords**: Neural Vector Autoregressions, time series forecasting, causality analysis, impulse response, deep learning, nonlinear dynamics."}
{"text": "The rapid decline in biodiversity necessitates efficient and scalable methods for monitoring wildlife populations. This study addresses the challenge of automated species recognition from camera trap images in European temperate forests, leveraging advancements in artificial intelligence (AI). The objective is to develop a robust AI-based system capable of accurately identifying mammal species from camera trap data, reducing the reliance on manual annotation and enabling large-scale biodiversity monitoring. A deep learning approach, utilizing convolutional neural networks (CNNs), was employed to train a species recognition model on a dataset of over 50,000 annotated images representing 15 mammal species. The model was optimized for accuracy and computational efficiency, incorporating techniques such as data augmentation and transfer learning to enhance performance. Results demonstrate that the proposed system achieves an average species recognition accuracy of 92.5%, outperforming traditional methods and existing benchmarks. The model also exhibits strong generalization capabilities across varying environmental conditions and camera trap setups.

{"text": "Sequence labeling is a fundamental task in natural language processing (NLP), with applications ranging from named entity recognition to part-of-speech tagging. Traditional approaches often rely on structured prediction models, such as conditional random fields (CRFs), which can be computationally expensive and limited in their ability to capture complex dependencies. This paper introduces Gaussian Process Pseudo-Likelihood Models (GPPLMs), a novel framework for sequence labeling that combines the flexibility of Gaussian processes with the efficiency of pseudo-likelihood estimation. Our approach leverages the non-parametric nature of Gaussian processes to model intricate dependencies between labels and features, while pseudo-likelihood estimation ensures scalability for large datasets. We evaluate GPPLMs on benchmark sequence labeling tasks, demonstrating significant improvements in accuracy compared to state-of-the-art methods, particularly in scenarios with limited labeled data. The results highlight the model's ability to generalize across diverse linguistic contexts and its robustness to noise. Furthermore, we discuss the potential applications of GPPLMs in low-resource NLP settings and their implications for advancing sequence labeling techniques. This work contributes a scalable, flexible, and high-performing alternative to traditional sequence labeling models, paving the way for future research in probabilistic modeling for NLP.  \n\n**Keywords**: Gaussian processes, sequence labeling, pseudo-likelihood models, natural language processing, structured prediction."}
{"text": "Medical image segmentation is a critical task in healthcare, enabling precise diagnosis and treatment planning. However, the scarcity of annotated medical datasets poses a significant challenge, particularly in one-shot learning scenarios where only a single labeled example is available. This paper addresses this limitation by proposing a novel data augmentation framework that leverages learned transformations to generate diverse and realistic synthetic medical images. Our approach employs a deep generative model trained to capture the underlying distribution of medical imaging data, enabling the synthesis of high-quality, anatomically plausible images. These augmented datasets are then used to train a segmentation model, significantly improving its performance in one-shot settings. Experimental results on benchmark medical imaging datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms traditional augmentation techniques, achieving higher segmentation accuracy and robustness. The proposed framework not only enhances the generalization capability of segmentation models but also reduces the dependency on large annotated datasets, making it a valuable tool for medical image analysis. This work contributes to advancing one-shot learning in medical imaging by introducing a scalable and effective data augmentation strategy, with potential applications in clinical diagnostics and personalized medicine.  \n\n**Keywords**: Medical image segmentation, one-shot learning, data augmentation, deep generative models, synthetic data, healthcare AI."}

{"text": "Vertical Federated Learning (VFL) has emerged as a promising paradigm for collaborative machine learning, enabling multiple parties to jointly train models without sharing raw data. However, ensuring fairness in VFL remains a critical challenge, as disparate data distributions and unequal contributions among participants can lead to biased outcomes. This paper addresses the problem of achieving model fairness in VFL by proposing a novel fairness-aware framework that integrates fairness constraints into the learning process. Our approach leverages adaptive optimization techniques and fairness metrics to balance model performance and equity across participating entities. We evaluate the proposed framework on real-world datasets, demonstrating its effectiveness in reducing bias while maintaining competitive accuracy compared to traditional VFL methods. The results highlight the framework's ability to promote fairness without compromising utility, offering a practical solution for equitable collaboration in VFL settings.

{"text": "This study investigates the impact of Q-function reuse on the total regret in tabular, model-free reinforcement learning (RL) environments. The objective is to determine whether reusing Q-functions from previously solved tasks can reduce cumulative regret when applied to new, related tasks, thereby improving learning efficiency. We employ a model-free RL framework, focusing on Q-learning and its variants, to evaluate the effectiveness of Q-function reuse across a series of tabular environments with varying degrees of task similarity. Our approach involves systematically transferring Q-values from source tasks to target tasks and analyzing the resulting regret bounds and convergence rates. Experimental results demonstrate that Q-function reuse significantly reduces total regret in scenarios where tasks share structural similarities, particularly in early learning phases. However, the benefits diminish as task divergence increases, highlighting the importance of task-relatedness in transfer learning. The findings suggest that Q-function reuse can serve as a practical strategy for accelerating learning in RL, especially in environments with repetitive or overlapping dynamics. This research contributes to the broader understanding of transfer learning in RL and provides insights into optimizing regret minimization for sequential decision-making tasks.  \n\n**Keywords**: Reinforcement Learning, Q-function Reuse, Regret Minimization, Transfer Learning, Tabular Environments, Model-Free RL."}

{"text": "Video object detection is a critical task in computer vision, aiming to accurately identify and localize objects across video frames. Despite significant advancements, challenges such as object occlusion, motion blur, and appearance variations persist, limiting the performance of existing methods. This paper introduces a novel *Object-aware Feature Aggregation (OFA)* framework designed to enhance video object detection by leveraging temporal and spatial information more effectively. The proposed approach integrates a multi-level feature aggregation mechanism that dynamically fuses object-specific features across frames, ensuring robust representation even under challenging conditions. Additionally, we introduce an attention-based module to prioritize relevant features while suppressing noise, further improving detection accuracy. Experiments conducted on benchmark datasets, including ImageNet VID and YouTube-VOS, demonstrate that OFA outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving significant improvements in both precision and recall. The framework\u2019s ability to handle complex scenarios, such as fast-moving objects and occlusions, highlights its practical applicability in real-world video analysis tasks. This research contributes to the field by providing a scalable and efficient solution for video object detection, with potential applications in surveillance, autonomous driving, and video content analysis.  \n\n**Keywords**: Video object detection, feature aggregation, object-aware representation, attention mechanism, temporal modeling."}
{"text": "The rapid advancement of automotive radar systems has raised critical questions about the trade-offs between sensor resolution and classification performance in real-world applications. This study investigates the necessity of high-resolution experimental radar systems compared to off-the-shelf, lower-resolution sensors for automotive radar classification tasks. We evaluate the performance of both sensor types in detecting and classifying common road objects, such as vehicles, pedestrians, and cyclists, under varying environmental conditions. A machine learning-based classification framework is employed to process radar data, leveraging feature extraction and supervised learning techniques to assess accuracy, precision, and recall metrics. Our findings reveal that while high-resolution experimental radar systems offer marginal improvements in classification accuracy, off-the-shelf sensors achieve comparable performance in most practical scenarios, particularly when combined with robust signal processing algorithms. These results suggest that cost-effective, lower-resolution sensors may suffice for many automotive applications, reducing the need for expensive, high-resolution systems. This research provides valuable insights for automotive manufacturers and researchers aiming to balance performance and cost in radar-based classification systems.  \n\n**Keywords**: automotive radar, sensor resolution, object classification, machine learning, signal processing, cost-performance trade-off."}

The primary objective of this work is to address the limitations of existing datasets, which often lack diversity in accident scenarios, high-resolution imagery, and detailed annotations. CADP comprises over 10,000 video clips captured from urban and highway traffic cameras, encompassing a wide range of accident types, lighting conditions, and weather scenarios. Each clip is annotated with precise accident labels, vehicle trajectories, and contextual metadata, enabling robust training and evaluation of accident detection and prediction models.  \n\nTo demonstrate the utility of CADP, we propose a deep learning-based framework leveraging convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and temporal modeling techniques to detect and predict accidents in real-time. Experimental results show that our approach achieves an accuracy of 92.3% in accident detection and a mean prediction time of 3.5 seconds before an accident occurs, outperforming existing methods on comparable datasets. The dataset and framework collectively provide a significant step forward in improving road safety through automated surveillance systems.  \n\nThe contributions of this research include the release of CADP as an open-source dataset, the development of a state-of-the-art accident analysis framework, and insights into the challenges of real-world traffic monitoring.

Non-local networks have demonstrated significant success in capturing long-range dependencies in tasks like image recognition and video analysis, but their computational complexity often limits their practical deployment. To overcome this limitation, we propose a novel Neural Architecture Search (NAS) framework specifically tailored for optimizing non-local networks. Our approach leverages a multi-objective optimization strategy to balance model accuracy and computational efficiency, incorporating lightweight attention mechanisms and efficient feature aggregation techniques. Experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate that our NAS-generated models achieve competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art non-local networks while significantly reducing computational overhead. For instance, our lightweight models achieve up to a 40% reduction in FLOPs with minimal accuracy degradation. The proposed framework not only advances the field of efficient neural network design but also provides a scalable solution for deploying non-local networks in real-world applications.

{"text": "Transfer learning has become a cornerstone in leveraging pre-trained models for new tasks, particularly in domains with limited labeled data. However, the challenge of adapting these models to new tasks without overfitting or losing generalization capabilities remains significant. This paper introduces *Dropping Networks*, a novel approach to transfer learning that dynamically adjusts the architecture of pre-trained models during fine-tuning. By selectively dropping layers or neurons based on their relevance to the target task, our method reduces overfitting and improves generalization. We evaluate Dropping Networks on multiple benchmark datasets across computer vision and natural language processing tasks, demonstrating consistent performance improvements over traditional fine-tuning methods. Experimental results show that our approach achieves higher accuracy and robustness, particularly in low-data regimes. The proposed method also offers computational efficiency by reducing the number of active parameters during training. This work contributes a scalable and effective strategy for transfer learning, with potential applications in domains such as medical imaging, autonomous systems, and personalized AI.

{"text": "This paper introduces a novel adaptive video super-resolution (SR) algorithm designed to enhance the robustness and performance of video upscaling in dynamic and noisy environments. The primary objective is to address the limitations of existing SR methods, which often struggle with artifacts, motion blur, and varying levels of noise in real-world video data. To achieve this, we propose a hybrid approach that combines deep learning-based feature extraction with adaptive filtering techniques. The algorithm dynamically adjusts its parameters based on the input video's characteristics, ensuring optimal performance across diverse scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate significant improvements in both visual quality and quantitative metrics, such as peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) and structural similarity index (SSIM), compared to state-of-the-art methods. The proposed solution also exhibits enhanced robustness to innovations, such as sudden scene changes and varying noise levels, making it suitable for applications in surveillance, medical imaging, and video streaming. This research contributes to the field by offering a more reliable and adaptable SR framework, paving the way for future advancements in real-time video enhancement technologies.  \n\n**Keywords**: video super-resolution, adaptive algorithms, deep learning, robustness, noise reduction, real-time processing."}
{"text": "Superpixel segmentation has emerged as a critical preprocessing step in various computer vision tasks, offering a compact representation of images while preserving essential structural information. However, existing methods often struggle to balance computational efficiency with the ability to capture hierarchical relationships within image regions. This paper introduces a novel approach to superpixel hierarchy generation, leveraging a multi-scale framework that dynamically adapts to the complexity of image content. Our method employs an iterative optimization process to construct a hierarchical tree of superpixels, enabling efficient representation of both fine-grained details and coarse structures. Experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of boundary adherence, region homogeneity, and computational scalability. Furthermore, the hierarchical nature of the generated superpixels facilitates applications in object recognition, image segmentation, and scene understanding. The key contribution of this work lies in its ability to seamlessly integrate hierarchical relationships into superpixel generation, offering a versatile and efficient solution for advanced computer vision tasks.

The objective of this research is to address the limitations of traditional autoregressive models in capturing long-range dependencies and complex patterns in high-dimensional data, such as time series and natural language. We propose a hybrid architecture that integrates autoregressive networks with spectral attention, leveraging the strengths of both approaches to improve predictive accuracy and computational efficiency. The spectral attention mechanism employs frequency-domain transformations to identify and prioritize critical temporal dependencies, enabling the model to focus on relevant features across different scales.  \n\nOur experiments demonstrate that the proposed model outperforms state-of-the-art autoregressive baselines on benchmark datasets, achieving significant improvements in prediction accuracy and robustness. The results highlight the model's ability to handle noisy and irregularly sampled data, making it suitable for applications in time-series forecasting, speech processing, and natural language understanding. Furthermore, the spectral attention mechanism reduces computational overhead compared to conventional attention-based models, offering a scalable solution for large-scale datasets.  \n\nThe key contribution of this work lies in the integration of spectral analysis with deep autoregressive frameworks, providing a new perspective on sequential data modeling. This approach not only enhances performance but also opens avenues for further research in attention mechanisms and their applications in AI-driven systems.

{"text": "Identifying disease-associated genes is a critical challenge in bioinformatics, with significant implications for understanding disease mechanisms and developing targeted therapies. Traditional link prediction methods in gene-disease networks often overlook the nuanced relationships between genes and diseases, leading to suboptimal performance. This paper proposes a novel **Relation-weighted Link Prediction (RLP)** framework to enhance disease gene identification by incorporating weighted relational features into a graph-based model. The approach leverages a heterogeneous network integrating gene-gene interactions, gene-disease associations, and biological pathway data. A graph neural network (GNN) is employed to learn node embeddings, while a relation-weighting mechanism dynamically adjusts the importance of different edge types during prediction. Experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that RLP outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of precision, recall, and F1-score. Key findings reveal that incorporating weighted relationships significantly improves the identification of both known and novel disease-associated genes. The proposed framework offers a robust and interpretable solution for advancing disease gene discovery, with potential applications in precision medicine and drug development.  \n\n**Keywords**: disease gene identification, link prediction, graph neural networks, relation weighting, bioinformatics, heterogeneous networks."}

This paper addresses the challenge of effectively learning shared representations across modalities by leveraging pairwise constraints. The objective is to enhance the alignment and correlation between heterogeneous data types, enabling more robust and accurate cross-modal retrieval and analysis. We propose a novel framework that integrates pairwise similarity and dissimilarity constraints into a unified learning model, ensuring that semantically related data points from different modalities are mapped closer in the embedding space. Our approach employs a combination of deep neural networks and optimization techniques to iteratively refine the cross-modal representations. Experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms existing state-of-the-art techniques in terms of retrieval accuracy and computational efficiency. The findings highlight the effectiveness of pairwise constraints in improving cross-modal alignment and suggest potential applications in multimedia retrieval, recommendation systems, and human-computer interaction.

The objective is to develop a robust and efficient method for interpolating between multiple images while preserving their structural and perceptual characteristics. Traditional image morphing techniques often struggle with maintaining consistency and smooth transitions, especially in complex natural scenes. To address this, we propose a novel approach leveraging optimal transport theory, specifically the Wasserstein distance, to compute barycenters that serve as intermediate representations between images. Our method incorporates constraints to ensure that the resulting morphs are visually coherent and retain key features of the input images. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach outperforms existing methods in terms of visual quality and computational efficiency. The findings highlight the potential of constrained Wasserstein barycenters for applications in computer vision, graphics, and image processing, offering a new perspective on image interpolation and transformation.

{"text": "The increasing sophistication of adversarial attacks poses significant challenges to the robustness of machine learning models, particularly in security-critical applications. This paper introduces **DAFAR (Defending against Adversaries by Feedback-Autoencoder Reconstruction)**, a novel defense mechanism designed to detect and mitigate adversarial perturbations in real-time. The proposed approach leverages a feedback-based autoencoder architecture to reconstruct input data, effectively filtering out adversarial noise while preserving the integrity of the original data. Unlike traditional defense methods, DAFAR incorporates a dynamic feedback loop that continuously refines the reconstruction process, enhancing its adaptability to evolving attack strategies.  \n\nExperiments conducted on benchmark datasets, including MNIST and CIFAR-10, demonstrate that DAFAR achieves state-of-the-art performance in adversarial detection and robustness, outperforming existing methods such as adversarial training and gradient masking. The system exhibits a significant reduction in misclassification rates under various attack scenarios, including FGSM, PGD, and C&W attacks. Furthermore, DAFAR maintains high accuracy on clean data, ensuring minimal impact on model performance in non-adversarial settings.  \n\nThe key contribution of this research lies in the integration of feedback mechanisms with autoencoder-based reconstruction, offering a scalable and efficient solution for adversarial defense. DAFAR\u2019s architecture is lightweight and can be seamlessly integrated into existing machine learning pipelines, making it suitable for real-world deployment. This work advances the field of adversarial machine learning by providing a robust, adaptive, and practical defense framework with broad applicability in cybersecurity, autonomous systems, and other domains vulnerable to adversarial threats.  \n\n**Keywords**: adversarial defense, autoencoder, feedback mechanism, machine learning robustness, cybersecurity, adversarial attacks."}

{"text": "Face retrieval systems are critical for applications in security, surveillance, and human-computer interaction. However, existing methods often struggle with challenges such as variations in lighting, pose, and facial expressions. This paper introduces the Local Directional Order Pattern (LDOP), a novel feature descriptor designed to enhance the robustness and accuracy of face retrieval systems. LDOP captures local directional information by encoding the relative order of pixel intensities within a neighborhood, making it resilient to illumination changes and noise. The proposed method is evaluated on benchmark datasets, including LFW and CASIA-WebFace, and demonstrates superior performance compared to state-of-the-art techniques such as LBP and HOG. Experimental results show that LDOP achieves higher retrieval accuracy and robustness across diverse conditions. The simplicity and computational efficiency of LDOP make it suitable for real-time applications. This research contributes a significant advancement in face retrieval by addressing key limitations of existing methods, paving the way for more reliable and scalable systems in real-world scenarios.  \n\n**Keywords**: Face retrieval, Local Directional Order Pattern (LDOP), feature descriptor, robustness, illumination invariance, real-time systems."}

This paper addresses the challenge of deep model compression by leveraging filter correlations within convolutional neural networks (CNNs). We propose a novel approach that identifies and exploits the inherent redundancies among filters to reduce model size and computational complexity without significant loss in performance. Our method involves analyzing filter similarity metrics and applying a structured pruning technique to eliminate redundant filters while preserving critical features. Experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves up to 70% reduction in model parameters and 50% reduction in floating-point operations (FLOPs), with minimal accuracy degradation. Furthermore, the compressed models exhibit improved inference speed, making them suitable for real-time applications on edge devices. This work contributes to the growing field of efficient deep learning by introducing a correlation-aware compression strategy that balances model efficiency and performance, paving the way for more sustainable and scalable AI deployments.  \n\n**Keywords**: deep learning, model compression, filter correlation, convolutional neural networks, structured pruning, edge computing."}

This paper presents a novel approach leveraging massively deep artificial neural networks (MDANNs) to achieve state-of-the-art performance in this domain. The proposed architecture incorporates a hierarchical structure of convolutional and recurrent layers, optimized for both spatial feature extraction and sequential pattern recognition. To address the computational complexity of deep networks, we introduce a lightweight pruning technique that reduces model size without compromising accuracy. The model is trained on the widely used MNIST dataset, augmented with synthetic variations to enhance robustness. Experimental results demonstrate a recognition accuracy of 99.8%, outperforming existing methods by 0.3%. Furthermore, the pruned model achieves a 40% reduction in inference time, making it suitable for real-time applications. The study highlights the potential of MDANNs in advancing optical character recognition (OCR) systems and provides insights into efficient deep learning architectures for resource-constrained environments. This work contributes to the ongoing development of scalable and accurate handwritten digit recognition systems, with implications for industries such as banking, logistics, and education.  \n\n**Keywords**: handwritten digit recognition, deep learning, convolutional neural networks, model pruning, MNIST dataset, optical character recognition."}

{"text": "This paper addresses the challenge of efficiently learning CHARME (Contextual Hierarchical Attention-based Recurrent Memory Encoder) models, which are designed to capture complex temporal dependencies and hierarchical structures in sequential data. Traditional approaches often struggle with scalability and computational efficiency, particularly when dealing with large-scale datasets. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel neural network-based framework that integrates advanced attention mechanisms and memory-augmented architectures. Our approach leverages multi-layer recurrent neural networks (RNNs) combined with hierarchical attention layers to dynamically focus on relevant temporal and contextual features. We evaluate the proposed model on benchmark datasets for sequential prediction tasks, demonstrating significant improvements in accuracy and computational efficiency compared to existing methods. The results highlight the model's ability to handle long-range dependencies and adapt to varying levels of data complexity. This research contributes to the advancement of sequential data modeling by introducing a scalable and interpretable framework, with potential applications in natural language processing, time-series analysis, and recommendation systems. Key innovations include the integration of hierarchical attention mechanisms and memory-augmented RNNs, which enhance both performance and interpretability.

This study proposes a novel framework that leverages graph structure and cooperative game theory to enhance the interpretability of deep learning models. The approach constructs a graph-based representation of the model\u2019s decision-making process, where nodes represent features and edges capture their interactions. Cooperative game theory is then applied to quantify the contribution of individual features and feature interactions to the model\u2019s predictions. This method not only provides a transparent interpretation of the model but also identifies key biomarkers associated with ASD. Experiments conducted on a large-scale neuroimaging dataset demonstrate that the proposed framework outperforms existing interpretability methods in terms of both accuracy and interpretability. The results reveal previously unidentified biomarkers, offering new insights into the underlying mechanisms of ASD. This research contributes to the field by bridging the gap between complex deep learning models and actionable clinical insights, paving the way for more reliable and interpretable AI-driven biomarker discovery.  \n\n**Keywords**: deep learning interpretability, graph structure, cooperative game theory, biomarker discovery, Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), neuroimaging, feature interaction."}
{"text": "The rapid growth of digital image data has necessitated efficient and scalable methods for large-scale image search. Traditional hashing techniques often rely on alternating optimization, which can be computationally expensive and prone to suboptimal solutions. This paper introduces a novel non-alternating graph hashing algorithm designed to address these challenges. The proposed method leverages graph-based learning to preserve semantic relationships between images while directly generating binary hash codes in a single optimization step, eliminating the need for alternating updates. By integrating graph Laplacian regularization and quantization constraints, the algorithm ensures both efficiency and accuracy in hash code generation. Experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of retrieval accuracy and computational efficiency. The algorithm achieves significant improvements in mean average precision (mAP) while reducing training time by up to 40% compared to alternating optimization-based methods. These findings highlight the potential of the non-alternating graph hashing algorithm for real-world applications in large-scale image retrieval systems. The proposed method offers a robust and scalable solution, paving the way for further advancements in efficient image search technologies.  \n\n**Keywords**: graph hashing, image retrieval, non-alternating optimization, binary codes, large-scale search, semantic preservation."}

{"text": "Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) has shown remarkable success in solving complex tasks, yet its generalization capabilities remain a critical challenge, particularly in environments with procedural level generation. This paper investigates the factors influencing generalization in DRL agents trained on procedurally generated levels, focusing on the interplay between level diversity, agent architecture, and training methodologies. We propose a systematic framework to evaluate generalization by introducing a novel benchmark suite of procedurally generated environments with varying complexity and structure. Our approach leverages advanced DRL algorithms, including Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) and Soft Actor-Critic (SAC), combined with curriculum learning and data augmentation techniques to enhance agent adaptability. Experimental results demonstrate that increasing level diversity during training significantly improves generalization, while architectural modifications, such as incorporating memory-augmented networks, further enhance performance. Our findings reveal that agents trained under diverse procedural generation conditions achieve up to 30% higher success rates in unseen environments compared to traditional training methods. This research provides actionable insights for designing DRL systems capable of robust generalization, with potential applications in gaming, robotics, and autonomous systems. Key contributions include a comprehensive evaluation framework, novel training strategies, and empirical evidence highlighting the importance of procedural diversity in DRL generalization. Keywords: Deep Reinforcement Learning, Procedural Level Generation, Generalization, Curriculum Learning, Memory-Augmented Networks."}
{"text": "This paper addresses the challenge of accurately predicting travel demand using time series data, a critical task for optimizing transportation systems and urban planning. Traditional approaches often treat travel demand prediction as a single-task problem, neglecting the interdependencies between related tasks such as traffic flow, passenger volume, and trip duration. To overcome this limitation, we propose a novel multi-task learning (MTL) framework that simultaneously models multiple time series tasks, leveraging shared representations to improve prediction accuracy. Our approach integrates advanced deep learning architectures, including recurrent neural networks (RNNs) and attention mechanisms, to capture temporal dependencies and task-specific patterns effectively. Experiments conducted on real-world travel demand datasets demonstrate that the proposed MTL framework outperforms single-task models and existing baselines, achieving significant improvements in prediction accuracy and robustness. The results highlight the importance of modeling task relationships in time series analysis and provide valuable insights for applications in smart transportation and resource allocation. This research contributes to the growing body of work on MTL in time series analysis and offers a scalable solution for enhancing travel demand forecasting systems.  \n\n**Keywords**: multi-task learning, time series, travel demand prediction, deep learning, recurrent neural networks, attention mechanisms."}

{"text": "This paper addresses the challenge of improving semantic understanding in video analysis using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). Traditional CNNs often struggle to capture the temporal dynamics and spatial transformations inherent in video data, limiting their effectiveness in tasks such as action recognition and scene understanding. To overcome this limitation, we propose a novel approach called *Representation Warping*, which dynamically aligns and warps feature representations across frames to better model temporal dependencies and spatial variations. Our method leverages optical flow and attention mechanisms to adaptively refine feature maps, ensuring robust and context-aware representations. Experiments conducted on benchmark datasets, including UCF101 and HMDB51, demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming existing methods by significant margins. The proposed framework not only enhances semantic video understanding but also provides a scalable solution for real-world applications such as surveillance, autonomous driving, and video summarization. This work contributes to advancing video analysis by introducing a computationally efficient and interpretable model that bridges the gap between spatial and temporal feature learning.  \n\n**Keywords**: Video understanding, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Representation Warping, Temporal modeling, Optical flow, Action recognition."}
{"text": "This paper addresses the challenge of achieving high-quality image super-resolution (SR) through interpretable deep multimodal learning. While deep learning-based SR methods have shown remarkable success, their lack of interpretability and reliance on single-modal data often limit their applicability in real-world scenarios. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel interpretable deep multimodal framework that integrates complementary information from multiple data modalities, such as RGB, depth, and infrared, to enhance SR performance. Our approach employs a hybrid architecture combining convolutional neural networks (CNNs) with attention mechanisms, enabling the model to dynamically prioritize relevant features across modalities. Additionally, we introduce a gradient-based interpretability module to provide insights into the decision-making process of the model. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art SR techniques in terms of both quantitative metrics (e.g., PSNR and SSIM) and qualitative visual results. The proposed framework not only achieves superior SR performance but also offers transparency, making it suitable for critical applications such as medical imaging and remote sensing. This work contributes to advancing interpretable multimodal learning in image processing and highlights the potential of leveraging diverse data sources for improved SR outcomes.  \n\n**Keywords**: image super-resolution, multimodal learning, interpretability, deep learning, attention mechanisms, convolutional neural networks."}

{"text": "Seed phenotyping is a critical task in agriculture, enabling the assessment of seed quality and traits for improved crop yield. Traditional methods often rely on manual inspection or limited datasets, which are time-consuming and lack scalability. This paper addresses these challenges by proposing a novel approach that combines domain randomization and transfer learning within a neural network framework. The objective is to enhance the accuracy and robustness of seed phenotyping models, particularly in scenarios with limited labeled data.  \n\nThe proposed method leverages domain randomization to generate diverse synthetic datasets, simulating various environmental conditions and seed variations. These datasets are used to pre-train a deep neural network, which is then fine-tuned using transfer learning on a smaller, real-world seed dataset. Experiments demonstrate that this approach significantly improves model performance, achieving higher accuracy and generalization compared to traditional methods. Key findings include a 15% increase in classification accuracy and enhanced robustness to variations in lighting, orientation, and seed morphology.  \n\nThe study highlights the potential of combining domain randomization and transfer learning for seed phenotyping, offering a scalable and efficient solution for agricultural applications. This research contributes to the advancement of automated phenotyping technologies, with implications for precision agriculture and crop improvement.  \n\n**Keywords**: seed phenotyping, domain randomization, transfer learning, neural networks, precision agriculture, synthetic data."}
{"text": "This paper introduces Regression Prior Networks (RPNs), a novel approach designed to enhance the robustness and interpretability of regression tasks in machine learning. The primary objective of this research is to address the limitations of traditional regression models, particularly in handling uncertainty estimation and out-of-distribution data. RPNs leverage probabilistic deep learning techniques to model prior distributions over regression parameters, enabling more accurate uncertainty quantification and improved generalization. The proposed method integrates a Bayesian framework with neural networks, allowing for flexible and scalable regression modeling. Experiments conducted on benchmark datasets demonstrate that RPNs outperform conventional regression models in terms of predictive accuracy and uncertainty calibration. Additionally, the framework provides interpretable insights into the underlying data distribution, making it suitable for applications in domains such as healthcare, finance, and autonomous systems. The key contribution of this work lies in its ability to combine the strengths of Bayesian inference and deep learning, offering a robust and interpretable solution for regression tasks. This research opens new avenues for developing reliable machine learning models in scenarios where uncertainty estimation and interpretability are critical.  \n\n**Keywords**: Regression Prior Networks, uncertainty estimation, Bayesian deep learning, probabilistic modeling, interpretability, out-of-distribution detection."}

This study addresses this problem by leveraging transfer learning, a machine learning technique that adapts pre-trained deep learning models to new tasks with limited data. We propose a novel approach utilizing convolutional neural networks (CNNs) fine-tuned on a curated dataset of microscopic foraminifera images. The methodology involves preprocessing the images to enhance feature extraction, followed by transfer learning using state-of-the-art architectures such as ResNet and EfficientNet. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves superior performance in both detection and classification tasks, with an accuracy of 95.7% and a mean average precision (mAP) of 92.3%, outperforming traditional methods. The findings highlight the effectiveness of transfer learning in handling domain-specific challenges with limited labeled data.

The proposed approach enables knowledge transfer across domains while ensuring data privacy and security.  \n\nThe SFTL framework employs a two-phase process: (1) a pre-training phase where a global model is fine-tuned using transfer learning on a shared, non-sensitive dataset, and (2) a federated learning phase where SMPC protocols are applied to securely aggregate model updates from participants. We evaluate SFTL on multiple benchmark datasets, demonstrating significant improvements in model accuracy (up to 15% compared to traditional FL) and robustness to data heterogeneity. Additionally, the framework maintains strong privacy guarantees, with negligible computational overhead.  \n\nThe key contributions of this work include a scalable and privacy-preserving transfer learning mechanism, a secure aggregation protocol resistant to adversarial attacks, and empirical validation of the framework's effectiveness in real-world scenarios.

{"text": "Semantic segmentation of urban scenes is a critical task for applications such as autonomous driving, urban planning, and augmented reality. However, models trained on one domain often struggle to generalize to new environments due to domain shifts caused by variations in lighting, weather, and urban layouts. This paper addresses the challenge of domain adaptation for semantic segmentation by proposing a novel curriculum-based approach. Our method progressively adapts the model from source to target domains by leveraging a curriculum that prioritizes easier-to-learn samples before tackling more complex ones. We introduce a dynamic weighting mechanism that adjusts the importance of samples based on their difficulty and domain relevance. Experiments on benchmark datasets, including Cityscapes and GTA5, demonstrate that our approach outperforms existing domain adaptation methods, achieving significant improvements in mean Intersection-over-Union (mIoU) scores. The results highlight the effectiveness of curriculum learning in mitigating domain shifts and enhancing model robustness. This work contributes a scalable and efficient framework for domain adaptation in semantic segmentation, with potential applications in real-world urban scene analysis and beyond.  \n\n**Keywords**: semantic segmentation, domain adaptation, curriculum learning, urban scenes, deep learning, computer vision."}

{"text": "This paper presents a self-consistent theory of Gaussian Processes (GPs) that effectively captures feature learning effects in finite-width Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). While GPs have been widely used to model infinite-width neural networks, their application to finite-width architectures, particularly CNNs, remains underexplored. We address this gap by developing a theoretical framework that integrates feature learning dynamics into GP-based models, enabling accurate predictions of CNN behavior in practical, finite-width settings. Our approach leverages kernel renormalization and gradient-based optimization to model how CNNs adapt their feature representations during training. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that our theory accurately predicts the performance of finite-width CNNs across various datasets and architectures, outperforming traditional infinite-width GP approximations. The results highlight the importance of feature learning in finite networks and provide a principled way to bridge the gap between theoretical GP models and real-world deep learning systems. This work contributes to a deeper understanding of neural network training dynamics and offers a foundation for designing more efficient and interpretable CNN architectures.  \n\n**Keywords**: Gaussian Processes, Convolutional Neural Networks, feature learning, kernel renormalization, finite-width networks, deep learning theory."}

{"text": "This paper investigates the performance of linear stochastic approximation (LSA) algorithms under constant step-size settings, with a focus on the role of iterate averaging in enhancing convergence properties. While traditional LSA methods rely on diminishing step-sizes to achieve optimal convergence, this work explores the benefits of employing a fixed step-size combined with averaging techniques to improve stability and convergence rates. We propose a novel framework that leverages iterate averaging to mitigate the variance introduced by constant step-sizes, enabling faster convergence to the optimal solution. Theoretical analysis demonstrates that the proposed approach achieves a balance between computational efficiency and statistical accuracy, outperforming conventional diminishing step-size methods in terms of both convergence speed and robustness. Experimental results on synthetic and real-world datasets validate the effectiveness of the approach, showing significant improvements in solution quality and runtime performance. The findings highlight the potential of constant step-size LSA with iterate averaging as a practical and scalable solution for large-scale optimization problems in machine learning and reinforcement learning. Key contributions include a rigorous theoretical foundation, empirical validation, and insights into the trade-offs between step-size selection and averaging strategies.  \n\n**Keywords**: Linear Stochastic Approximation, Constant Step-Size, Iterate Averaging, Optimization, Machine Learning, Reinforcement Learning."}
{"text": "This paper addresses the challenge of online hard distractor discrimination in visual object tracking, a critical issue that impacts the robustness and accuracy of tracking systems in complex environments. We propose Cascaded Regression Tracking (CRT), a novel framework designed to enhance discrimination between the target object and hard distractors in real-time. CRT leverages a cascaded regression approach, combining multiple stages of feature extraction and refinement to progressively improve tracking precision. Each stage focuses on distinguishing subtle differences between the target and distractors, enabling the system to adapt dynamically to challenging scenarios. Our method integrates lightweight yet effective feature representations, ensuring computational efficiency suitable for online applications.  \n\nExperimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate that CRT achieves superior performance compared to state-of-the-art tracking methods, particularly in scenarios with high distractor interference. The proposed framework reduces tracking failures by 15% and improves accuracy by 12% on average. Furthermore, CRT exhibits robustness to occlusions, scale variations, and background clutter, making it a promising solution for real-world applications such as surveillance, autonomous navigation, and human-computer interaction. This work contributes a significant advancement in online tracking by introducing a cascaded regression mechanism that effectively addresses hard distractor discrimination, paving the way for more reliable and adaptive tracking systems.  \n\n**Keywords**: Visual object tracking, cascaded regression, hard distractor discrimination, online tracking, feature refinement, real-time systems."}

The discriminator of the GAN is simultaneously trained to classify real images, effectively integrating semi-supervised learning into the adversarial framework.  \n\nWe evaluate the proposed approach on benchmark image datasets, comparing its performance against state-of-the-art semi-supervised learning techniques. Experimental results demonstrate that *Vanishing Twin GAN* achieves superior classification accuracy, particularly in scenarios with scarce labeled data. The weak GAN's constrained generator prevents overfitting to synthetic data, ensuring that the discriminator focuses on meaningful features from real images.  \n\nThe key contribution of this work lies in the innovative use of a deliberately weakened GAN to improve semi-supervised learning, offering a computationally efficient and effective solution for image classification tasks. This approach has broad implications for applications in medical imaging, autonomous systems, and other domains where labeled data is scarce.  \n\n**Keywords**: Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), semi-supervised learning, image classification, weak GAN, vanishing twin, synthetic data."}

We propose Frustum PointNets, a novel framework that leverages both 2D image data and 3D point clouds to accurately detect and localize objects in 3D space.

Within these frustums, a PointNet-based architecture is employed to directly process the unordered point sets, enabling precise 3D bounding box estimation and object classification. Our method eliminates the need for handcrafted features or voxelization, making it computationally efficient and robust to varying point densities. Experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate that Frustum PointNets achieve state-of-the-art performance, outperforming existing methods in terms of both accuracy and speed.

{"text": "This paper addresses the challenge of learning adversarially robust representations in machine learning models, a critical requirement for ensuring reliability in real-world applications. We propose a novel framework based on *Worst-Case Mutual Information Maximization* (WC-MIM), which enhances the robustness of learned representations against adversarial attacks. Unlike traditional methods that focus on minimizing loss under worst-case perturbations, our approach explicitly maximizes mutual information between input data and their representations under adversarial conditions. This ensures that the learned features retain meaningful information even when subjected to adversarial noise. We implement WC-MIM using a combination of adversarial training and mutual information estimation techniques, leveraging contrastive learning principles to improve representation quality. Experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art robustness against a variety of adversarial attacks, outperforming existing approaches in terms of both accuracy and resilience. Furthermore, the proposed framework exhibits improved generalization capabilities, making it suitable for deployment in security-sensitive domains such as autonomous systems and cybersecurity. This work contributes a principled and effective approach to adversarial robustness, offering a new perspective on representation learning in the presence of adversarial threats.  \n\n**Keywords**: adversarial robustness, mutual information maximization, representation learning, adversarial training, contrastive learning, machine learning security."}

To address this, we propose a wavelet-based deep learning framework that decomposes the input image into multiple frequency bands, enabling the model to capture both global structures and local details effectively. Our approach integrates a convolutional neural network (CNN) with wavelet transforms, allowing the model to process spatial and frequency information simultaneously.

{"text": "Siamese trackers have gained significant attention in visual object tracking due to their efficiency and accuracy. However, their performance is often limited by challenges such as scale variations in target objects. This paper addresses this limitation by introducing scale-equivariant architectures into Siamese tracking frameworks. The proposed approach leverages the principles of scale equivariance, enabling the model to inherently adapt to scale transformations without requiring explicit scale estimation modules. We design a novel convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture that incorporates scale-equivariant layers, ensuring consistent feature representations across varying scales. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets, including OTB-100 and LaSOT, demonstrate that the proposed method achieves superior tracking accuracy and robustness compared to traditional Siamese trackers. Notably, our approach reduces the average scale error by 15% and improves overall success rates by 8%. The results highlight the importance of scale-equivariant representations in enhancing tracking performance, particularly in scenarios with significant scale changes. This work contributes to advancing the field of visual object tracking by introducing a scalable and efficient solution for handling scale variations, with potential applications in surveillance, autonomous systems, and video analysis.  \n\n**Keywords**: Siamese tracking, scale equivariance, object tracking, convolutional neural networks, visual tracking, scale variations."}

{"text": "Spectral clustering has emerged as a powerful technique for data partitioning, particularly in scenarios where traditional clustering methods struggle with complex, non-linear structures. This paper presents a novel topological approach to spectral clustering, leveraging concepts from algebraic topology to enhance the robustness and interpretability of clustering results. The proposed method integrates persistent homology, a tool from topological data analysis, to identify and preserve intrinsic geometric features of the data during the clustering process. By constructing a topological representation of the data, our approach improves the quality of the affinity matrix used in spectral clustering, leading to more accurate and stable cluster assignments. Experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms conventional spectral clustering techniques, particularly in handling noisy and high-dimensional data. The results highlight the potential of topological insights to advance clustering algorithms, offering new avenues for applications in areas such as image segmentation, social network analysis, and bioinformatics.

{"text": "Activity recognition in smart home systems is critical for enabling personalized and context-aware services, yet the lack of explainability in existing models limits their adoption and trustworthiness. This paper addresses the challenge of developing explainable activity recognition systems that balance accuracy with interpretability. We propose a novel hybrid approach combining deep learning models with rule-based reasoning to enhance transparency in decision-making. Our method leverages sensor data from smart home environments and employs a two-stage process: first, a deep neural network extracts high-level activity patterns, and second, a rule-based system provides human-understandable explanations for the predicted activities. Experiments conducted on a publicly available dataset demonstrate that our approach achieves competitive accuracy while significantly improving interpretability compared to traditional black-box models. The results highlight the potential of our framework to bridge the gap between complex machine learning techniques and user-centric explainability in smart home applications. This research contributes to the growing field of explainable AI by offering a practical solution for enhancing trust and usability in activity recognition systems, paving the way for broader adoption in real-world smart home environments.  \n\n**Keywords**: activity recognition, explainable AI, smart home systems, deep learning, rule-based reasoning, interpretability."}

{"text": "This paper addresses the challenge of learning effective video representations by decomposing long- and short-view features through contrastive learning. The objective is to enhance the understanding of temporal dynamics in videos by distinguishing between global context (long-view) and fine-grained temporal details (short-view). We propose a novel framework that leverages contrastive learning to disentangle these features, enabling the model to capture both high-level semantics and low-level motion patterns. Our approach employs a dual-branch architecture, where one branch focuses on long-view features by aggregating temporal information over extended sequences, while the other emphasizes short-view features by analyzing localized temporal segments. A contrastive loss function is introduced to maximize the mutual information between these complementary views while minimizing redundancy. Experimental results on benchmark video datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms existing approaches in tasks such as action recognition and video retrieval. The proposed framework achieves state-of-the-art performance, highlighting its ability to effectively decompose and utilize temporal features. This research contributes to the field of video representation learning by providing a robust and interpretable model for capturing multi-scale temporal dynamics, with potential applications in video analysis, surveillance, and human-computer interaction.  \n\n**Keywords**: video representation learning, contrastive learning, feature decomposition, temporal dynamics, action recognition, video retrieval."}

{"text": "Graph Attention Networks (GATs) have emerged as a powerful framework for learning representations of graph-structured data, leveraging attention mechanisms to capture node relationships. However, the extent to which GATs truly exploit attention mechanisms remains underexplored. This study investigates the effectiveness of attention in GATs, aiming to quantify their attentiveness and identify potential limitations. We propose a systematic evaluation framework to analyze the attention weights learned by GATs across diverse graph datasets. Our experiments reveal that, in many cases, GATs exhibit limited variability in attention weights, often approximating a uniform distribution. This suggests that the attention mechanism may not be fully utilized as intended. To address this, we introduce a modified attention mechanism that enhances the model's ability to focus on relevant node features, improving performance on benchmark tasks. Our findings highlight the importance of rigorously evaluating attention mechanisms in graph neural networks and provide insights into designing more effective architectures.

This paper introduces a novel approach, AU-Expression Knowledge Constrained Representation Learning (AUE-KCRL), which leverages Action Unit (AU) information to enhance FER by incorporating domain-specific knowledge into the learning process. The proposed method integrates AU-based constraints into a deep learning framework, enabling the model to learn more discriminative and interpretable facial representations. We evaluate AUE-KCRL on benchmark datasets, including FER2013 and CK+, and demonstrate significant improvements in recognition accuracy compared to state-of-the-art methods. Experimental results show that our approach achieves robust performance under varying lighting conditions, occlusions, and pose changes. The key contribution of this work lies in its ability to bridge the gap between AU-based and expression-based representations, offering a unified framework for FER. This research has practical implications for real-world applications, such as emotion-aware systems and mental health monitoring, where accurate and reliable expression recognition is essential.  \n\n**Keywords**: Facial Expression Recognition, Action Units, Representation Learning, Deep Learning, Emotion Analysis, Human-Computer Interaction."}
{"text": "Visual Place Recognition (VPR) is a critical task in robotics and autonomous systems, enabling machines to identify previously visited locations using visual data. However, existing methods often struggle in environments that undergo discrete or continuous changes, such as lighting variations, seasonal shifts, or dynamic objects. This paper addresses these challenges by proposing novel unsupervised learning methods tailored for VPR in such environments. Our approach leverages self-supervised feature learning and contrastive representation techniques to enhance robustness against environmental changes without requiring labeled data. We introduce a multi-scale feature aggregation framework that captures both local and global context, improving recognition accuracy across diverse scenarios. Experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art supervised and unsupervised approaches, achieving higher precision and recall in both discretely and continuously changing environments. The proposed framework also exhibits superior generalization capabilities, making it suitable for real-world applications in robotics, augmented reality, and autonomous navigation. This research contributes to advancing unsupervised learning in VPR by providing a scalable and adaptable solution for dynamic environments, paving the way for more reliable and efficient place recognition systems.  \n\n**Keywords**: Visual Place Recognition, Unsupervised Learning, Self-Supervised Learning, Contrastive Learning, Dynamic Environments, Robotics, Autonomous Systems."}

{"text": "This paper addresses the challenge of achieving temporal shape super-resolution in dynamic 3D reconstruction, a critical requirement for applications such as motion capture, robotics, and augmented reality. Traditional methods often struggle to accurately reconstruct high-speed deformations due to limited frame rates and motion blur. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel approach that leverages intra-frame motion encoding using high-frame-rate structured light. Our method captures fine-grained temporal details by encoding motion information within individual frames, enabling the reconstruction of high-resolution 3D shapes at unprecedented temporal fidelity. We introduce a computational framework that integrates motion estimation and shape refinement, utilizing advanced optimization techniques to enhance accuracy and robustness. Experimental results demonstrate significant improvements in reconstruction quality, with our method outperforming existing approaches in terms of both spatial and temporal resolution. The proposed technique achieves a 30% reduction in motion blur and a 25% increase in shape detail recovery compared to state-of-the-art methods. This research contributes a scalable and efficient solution for high-speed 3D reconstruction, with potential applications in real-time motion analysis and interactive systems.

{"text": "Convolutional Neural Networks (ConvNets) have achieved remarkable success in various computer vision tasks, yet their interpretability remains a significant challenge. This paper introduces a novel approach to enhance the interpretability of ConvNets by growing interpretable part graphs through multi-shot learning. The proposed method leverages a hierarchical framework to identify and represent meaningful visual parts within images, enabling the network to construct interpretable graphs that reflect the relationships between these parts. By employing multi-shot learning, the model iteratively refines its understanding of part structures across multiple training iterations, improving both accuracy and transparency. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach not only achieves competitive performance on benchmark datasets but also provides intuitive visual explanations of the decision-making process. The generated part graphs offer insights into how the network organizes and processes visual information, bridging the gap between deep learning and human interpretability. This work contributes to the growing field of explainable AI by offering a scalable and effective method for enhancing the transparency of ConvNets, with potential applications in medical imaging, autonomous systems, and other domains requiring trustworthy AI.  \n\n**Keywords**: Interpretability, Convolutional Neural Networks, Part Graphs, Multi-Shot Learning, Explainable AI, Computer Vision."}
{"text": "Semantic segmentation is a critical task in computer vision, but its performance often degrades when models trained on one domain are applied to another with different visual characteristics. This paper introduces **ColorMapGAN**, a novel unsupervised domain adaptation framework designed to address this challenge using color mapping generative adversarial networks (GANs). The objective of this work is to bridge the domain gap by aligning the color distributions of source and target domains without requiring labeled target data. Our approach leverages a GAN-based architecture to learn a color mapping function that transforms the source domain images to resemble the target domain while preserving semantic content. The proposed method integrates a segmentation network trained on the transformed source images and evaluated on the target domain. Experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate that **ColorMapGAN** achieves significant improvements in segmentation accuracy compared to existing unsupervised domain adaptation methods. Key findings include enhanced cross-domain generalization and robustness to varying visual conditions. This research contributes a practical and efficient solution for real-world applications where labeled target data is scarce, such as autonomous driving and medical imaging. The framework's ability to adapt to diverse domains without supervision highlights its potential for broader adoption in semantic segmentation tasks.  \n\n**Keywords**: unsupervised domain adaptation, semantic segmentation, generative adversarial networks, color mapping, cross-domain generalization, computer vision."}

However, traditional supervised methods require extensive labeled data, which is often costly and time-consuming to obtain. This paper proposes an Attentive Weakly Supervised Learning (AWSL) framework for land cover mapping, leveraging weakly labeled SITS data to reduce annotation efforts while maintaining high accuracy. The proposed approach integrates object-based analysis with temporal attention mechanisms to capture spatial and temporal dependencies in satellite imagery. By focusing on key temporal features, the model enhances interpretability and improves classification performance. Experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate that the AWSL framework achieves competitive accuracy compared to fully supervised methods, with significant reductions in labeling requirements. Additionally, spatial interpretation maps generated by the model provide valuable insights into land cover dynamics, aiding decision-making processes.

{"text": "This paper addresses the challenge of quantifying uncertainty in classification tasks, a critical aspect for improving the reliability of machine learning models in real-world applications. We propose a novel logit-based uncertainty measure that leverages the raw output scores (logits) from neural networks to estimate prediction confidence without requiring additional computational overhead. Our approach introduces a probabilistic framework that interprets logits to distinguish between high-confidence predictions and uncertain ones, enabling better decision-making in scenarios where model confidence is crucial. Experiments conducted on benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms traditional uncertainty estimation techniques, such as softmax-based confidence scores, in terms of both accuracy and robustness. The results highlight the effectiveness of our measure in identifying misclassifications and ambiguous predictions, particularly in high-stakes domains like healthcare and autonomous systems. This work contributes a computationally efficient and interpretable solution for uncertainty quantification, paving the way for more trustworthy and deployable machine learning models.  \n\n**Keywords**: uncertainty quantification, logits, classification, confidence estimation, machine learning, neural networks."}
{"text": "Offline reinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as a promising approach for training decision-making agents using pre-collected datasets without requiring online interaction with the environment. This paper explores the practical challenges and methodologies of implementing offline RL in real-world scenarios. The objective is to evaluate the effectiveness of offline RL algorithms in learning optimal policies from static datasets, particularly in environments where online exploration is costly or infeasible. We employ state-of-the-art offline RL techniques, including conservative Q-learning (CQL) and behavior regularization methods, to address issues such as distributional shift and overestimation of out-of-distribution actions. Our experiments are conducted on benchmark datasets and simulated environments, comparing the performance of offline RL algorithms against traditional online RL and imitation learning approaches. Results demonstrate that offline RL can achieve competitive performance, especially in scenarios with high-quality datasets, while highlighting limitations in data-scarce or noisy settings. The findings underscore the potential of offline RL for applications in robotics, healthcare, and autonomous systems, where safety and data efficiency are critical. This work contributes to the growing body of research on offline RL by providing practical insights into algorithm selection, dataset quality, and deployment considerations.  \n\n**Keywords**: Offline reinforcement learning, conservative Q-learning, behavior regularization, distributional shift, decision-making, dataset-driven learning."}

{"text": "Graph clustering is a fundamental problem in network analysis, with applications ranging from social networks to biological systems. Despite significant progress, the evaluation of clustering algorithms often lacks a rigorous theoretical foundation, particularly in terms of consistency with intuitive clustering properties. This paper introduces a novel consistency axiom for graph clustering, which formalizes the idea that a clustering algorithm should produce stable and meaningful results under specific transformations of the input graph. We propose a theoretical framework to analyze the feasibility of this axiom and derive possibility results, demonstrating that certain classes of clustering algorithms can satisfy the proposed consistency property. Through extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets, we validate the practical implications of our findings, showing that algorithms adhering to the axiom yield more interpretable and robust clusterings. Our work contributes to the theoretical understanding of graph clustering and provides a principled basis for evaluating and designing clustering algorithms. Key implications include improved algorithm design and enhanced interpretability of clustering results in complex networks.  \n\n**Keywords**: graph clustering, consistency axiom, network analysis, algorithm design, interpretability."}

{"text": "Causal inference plays a critical role in decision-making processes across various domains, from healthcare to economics. However, optimizing interventions under causal constraints remains a challenging problem due to the complexity of causal relationships and the need for efficient exploration of high-dimensional spaces. This paper introduces *Causal Bayesian Optimization* (CBO), a novel framework that integrates causal inference with Bayesian optimization to efficiently identify optimal interventions while respecting causal dependencies. The proposed approach leverages structural causal models (SCMs) to encode domain knowledge and employs Gaussian processes to model the causal effects of interventions. By incorporating causal constraints into the acquisition function, CBO ensures that optimization respects the underlying causal structure, leading to more interpretable and reliable results. Experimental evaluations on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that CBO outperforms traditional optimization methods in terms of both efficiency and accuracy, particularly in scenarios with complex causal relationships. The findings highlight the potential of CBO for applications in personalized medicine, policy design, and other domains where causal understanding is essential. This work contributes a scalable and principled approach to causal optimization, bridging the gap between causal inference and decision-making under uncertainty.  \n\n**Keywords**: Causal inference, Bayesian optimization, structural causal models, Gaussian processes, intervention optimization, decision-making."}

{"text": "Reinforcement Learning (RL) has shown remarkable success in various domains, yet its performance often degrades when deployed in environments with unobserved contextual information. This paper addresses the challenge of transfer reinforcement learning under such conditions, where the agent must adapt to unseen contexts without explicit knowledge of the underlying environmental dynamics. We propose a novel framework that leverages meta-learning and context inference techniques to enable efficient transfer across environments with latent contextual variables. Our approach combines a context-aware policy network with a probabilistic model to infer unobserved contexts and adapt the agent's strategy accordingly. Experimental results on benchmark environments demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms traditional RL and transfer learning baselines, achieving higher robustness and generalization capabilities. The proposed framework not only advances the state-of-the-art in transfer RL but also provides a practical solution for real-world applications where contextual information is often incomplete or unavailable. Key contributions include a scalable context inference mechanism and a transferable policy architecture that can be applied to diverse domains such as robotics, autonomous systems, and adaptive control.

{"text": "The generation of realistic medical time series data is critical for advancing research in healthcare analytics, particularly in scenarios where data privacy or scarcity limits access to real-world datasets. This paper addresses the challenge of generating high-quality, real-valued medical time series data using a novel approach based on Recurrent Conditional Generative Adversarial Networks (RC-GANs). The proposed model leverages the temporal dependencies inherent in medical time series, such as electrocardiogram (ECG) or blood pressure recordings, to produce synthetic data that closely mimics real-world patterns. The RC-GAN framework incorporates a recurrent neural network (RNN) architecture within both the generator and discriminator, enabling the model to capture long-term dependencies and complex dynamics in the data. Additionally, conditional inputs are used to guide the generation process, ensuring that the synthetic data aligns with specific clinical conditions or patient characteristics. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed RC-GAN outperforms existing methods in terms of data fidelity, as measured by statistical similarity metrics and domain expert evaluations. The generated data also proves effective in downstream tasks, such as training machine learning models for disease prediction, without compromising patient privacy. This work contributes a robust and scalable solution for synthetic medical time series generation, with potential applications in healthcare research, data augmentation, and privacy-preserving analytics.  \n\n**Keywords**: Medical time series, Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), Synthetic data generation, Healthcare analytics, Privacy-preserving data."}
{"text": "Lifelong learning in robotics is a critical challenge, as robots must continuously adapt to new tasks and environments while retaining previously acquired knowledge. This paper addresses the problem of lifelong robotic reinforcement learning (RL) by proposing a novel framework that enables robots to retain and reuse past experiences effectively. The objective is to enhance learning efficiency and adaptability in dynamic settings without catastrophic forgetting. Our approach integrates experience replay mechanisms with a dynamic memory architecture, allowing the robot to prioritize and store relevant experiences for future tasks. We evaluate the proposed method using a series of simulated and real-world robotic tasks, demonstrating significant improvements in task performance and learning speed compared to traditional RL methods. The results show that our framework not only mitigates forgetting but also facilitates faster adaptation to new tasks by leveraging prior knowledge. This research contributes to advancing lifelong learning in robotics, offering a scalable solution for real-world applications where continuous learning is essential. Key innovations include the dynamic memory prioritization strategy and the integration of experience retention into RL pipelines. The implications of this work extend to autonomous systems, industrial robotics, and AI-driven applications requiring adaptive learning capabilities.  \n\n**Keywords**: lifelong learning, reinforcement learning, robotics, experience replay, memory retention, adaptive systems."}

The objective is to enable precise and context-aware modifications to segmentation outputs while preserving semantic consistency and structural integrity. To achieve this, we propose a novel approach leveraging a multi-expansion loss function, which optimizes the editing process by simultaneously considering local and global semantic relationships. Our method integrates a deep learning framework that iteratively refines segmentation maps, ensuring high-quality edits without compromising the underlying semantic structure. Experimental results demonstrate significant improvements in editing accuracy and visual coherence compared to existing techniques, particularly in complex scenes with overlapping objects and fine-grained details. The proposed approach also exhibits robust performance across diverse datasets, highlighting its generalizability. This research contributes a scalable and efficient solution for semantic editing, with potential applications in medical imaging, autonomous driving, and augmented reality.

Traditional methods often struggle to balance spatial and angular resolution due to hardware limitations and computational complexity. To overcome these challenges, we propose a novel attention-guided fusion framework that leverages hybrid lenses to capture and process light field data more effectively. Our approach integrates a dual-branch network architecture, combining a high-resolution spatial branch with an angular refinement branch, guided by an attention mechanism to dynamically fuse features from both domains. The proposed model is trained on a diverse dataset of light field images, and extensive experiments demonstrate its superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods, achieving significant improvements in both visual quality and quantitative metrics such as PSNR and SSIM. The results highlight the effectiveness of our attention-guided fusion strategy in preserving fine details and enhancing angular consistency.

While model-free reinforcement learning (RL) has shown promise in VLN, it often struggles with long-term planning and generalization. Conversely, model-based RL excels in planning but faces scalability issues in complex environments. This paper introduces a novel framework that bridges model-free and model-based RL for VLN, enabling agents to \"look before they leap\" by incorporating planned-ahead reasoning. Our approach integrates a lightweight predictive model to simulate future states and rewards, guiding the agent\u2019s decision-making process while maintaining the efficiency of model-free methods. Experiments on benchmark VLN datasets demonstrate significant improvements in navigation success rates and path efficiency compared to state-of-the-art baselines. The proposed framework not only enhances the agent\u2019s ability to handle ambiguous instructions but also improves generalization to unseen environments. This work contributes a scalable, hybrid RL solution for VLN, offering new insights into combining the strengths of model-free and model-based approaches for complex, real-world tasks.  \n\n**Keywords**: Vision-and-Language Navigation, Reinforcement Learning, Model-Free RL, Model-Based RL, Planning, AI Navigation, Robotics."}

{"text": "This paper addresses the challenge of object detection and segmentation in scenarios where only weakly labeled data is available. Traditional methods often rely on extensive annotated datasets, which are costly and time-consuming to produce. To overcome this limitation, we propose a novel Weakly Supervised Cascaded Convolutional Network (WSCCN) framework that leverages weak supervision to achieve competitive performance with minimal annotation effort. The proposed approach integrates a cascaded architecture of convolutional networks, where each stage progressively refines the localization and segmentation of objects using only image-level labels. The first stage generates coarse object proposals, while subsequent stages iteratively improve the accuracy through attention mechanisms and region refinement techniques. Experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate that WSCCN achieves state-of-the-art performance in weakly supervised object detection and segmentation tasks, outperforming existing methods by a significant margin. The framework\u2019s ability to generalize across diverse datasets and its computational efficiency make it a practical solution for real-world applications. This research contributes to advancing weakly supervised learning in computer vision, offering a scalable and cost-effective alternative to fully supervised approaches.  \n\n**Keywords**: Weakly supervised learning, convolutional networks, object detection, image segmentation, cascaded architecture, attention mechanisms."}
{"text": "This paper addresses the challenge of dense 3D reconstruction from multi-view images without relying on dense correspondences, a common limitation in traditional methods. We propose a novel framework that leverages sparse feature matching and advanced neural rendering techniques to achieve high-quality 3D reconstructions. Our approach combines a feature extraction module with a differentiable rendering pipeline, enabling the system to infer dense geometry and texture from sparse input data. By eliminating the need for dense correspondences, our method significantly reduces computational complexity while maintaining robustness in scenarios with limited or noisy data. Experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate that our approach outperforms existing methods in terms of reconstruction accuracy and efficiency, particularly in challenging environments with occlusions or low-texture regions. The proposed framework not only advances the state-of-the-art in 3D reconstruction but also opens new possibilities for applications in augmented reality, robotics, and digital content creation. Key contributions include a lightweight architecture, improved scalability, and enhanced generalization across diverse datasets.  \n\n**Keywords**: 3D reconstruction, multi-view imaging, sparse correspondences, neural rendering, feature extraction, computational efficiency."}

{"text": "Domain generalization (DG) aims to enable machine learning models to perform robustly across unseen target domains by learning invariant features from multiple source domains. However, existing gradient masking strategies often struggle to effectively identify and leverage these invariances, limiting model generalization. This paper introduces **SAND-mask**, an enhanced gradient masking strategy designed to improve the discovery of domain-invariant features. SAND-mask employs a novel gradient-based approach that selectively masks gradients during training, prioritizing features that exhibit consistent behavior across domains while suppressing domain-specific variations. We evaluate SAND-mask on benchmark DG datasets, demonstrating significant improvements in generalization performance compared to state-of-the-art methods. Experimental results show that SAND-mask achieves superior accuracy and robustness, particularly in scenarios with high domain shift. The proposed method also exhibits strong scalability and compatibility with existing DG frameworks. This work contributes a practical and effective solution to the challenge of domain generalization, with potential applications in areas such as computer vision, natural language processing, and healthcare.  \n\n**Keywords**: domain generalization, gradient masking, invariant features, machine learning, domain shift, SAND-mask."}
{"text": "The rapid advancements in deep learning have reignited discussions on the role of data in achieving state-of-the-art performance across various domains. This paper revisits the concept of the \"unreasonable effectiveness of data\" in the context of modern deep learning systems, exploring how the scale and quality of datasets influence model performance. We investigate the relationship between data volume, model complexity, and generalization capabilities, focusing on large-scale datasets and their impact on training deep neural networks. Through extensive experiments, we evaluate the performance of models trained on datasets of varying sizes and compositions, comparing their accuracy, robustness, and efficiency. Our findings reveal that while increasing data quantity often leads to improved performance, the marginal gains diminish beyond a certain threshold, highlighting the importance of data quality and diversity. Furthermore, we demonstrate that advanced techniques such as data augmentation, transfer learning, and self-supervised learning can significantly enhance model performance even with limited data. The study concludes with insights into optimizing data utilization for deep learning, emphasizing the need for balanced approaches that consider both quantity and quality. This work contributes to the ongoing discourse on data-centric AI, offering practical guidelines for researchers and practitioners aiming to maximize the effectiveness of data in the deep learning era.  \n\n**Keywords**: deep learning, data effectiveness, large-scale datasets, model performance, data augmentation, transfer learning, self-supervised learning."}

{"text": "Event-based vision sensors capture dynamic scenes with high temporal resolution and low power consumption, making them ideal for real-time applications. However, processing event-based data poses significant challenges due to its asynchronous and sparse nature. This paper introduces **Event-LSTM**, a novel unsupervised learning framework designed to effectively represent and process event-based data. The proposed approach leverages Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks to model temporal dependencies in an asynchronous manner, eliminating the need for labeled datasets. Event-LSTM operates directly on raw event streams, preserving the inherent sparsity and temporal precision of the data. Experimental results demonstrate that Event-LSTM outperforms existing methods in tasks such as event-based object recognition and motion prediction, achieving state-of-the-art performance with reduced computational overhead. The framework\u2019s unsupervised nature and ability to handle asynchronous inputs make it highly adaptable for real-world applications, including robotics, autonomous systems, and low-power edge devices. This work contributes a significant advancement in event-based data representation, offering a scalable and efficient solution for processing sparse temporal data.  \n\n**Keywords**: Event-based vision, LSTM, unsupervised learning, asynchronous processing, spatiotemporal representation, event cameras."}

{"text": "Monocular 3D object detection is a critical challenge in computer vision, with applications in autonomous driving, robotics, and augmented reality. This paper introduces the Deep Fitting Degree Scoring Network (DFDS-Net), a novel framework designed to improve the accuracy and robustness of 3D object detection from single-view images. The proposed approach leverages a deep learning-based scoring mechanism to evaluate the fitting degree between 2D image features and 3D object hypotheses, enabling more precise localization and orientation estimation. DFDS-Net integrates a multi-task architecture that simultaneously optimizes for object classification, 3D bounding box regression, and fitting degree scoring, ensuring a holistic understanding of the scene. Experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate that DFDS-Net outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of both accuracy and computational efficiency. The framework achieves significant improvements in 3D object localization, particularly in challenging scenarios with occlusions and varying lighting conditions. This research contributes to advancing monocular 3D detection by introducing a robust scoring mechanism that enhances the alignment between 2D and 3D representations, paving the way for more reliable real-world applications.  \n\n**Keywords**: Monocular 3D object detection, deep learning, fitting degree scoring, autonomous driving, computer vision, 3D localization."}
{"text": "This paper addresses the challenge of autonomous navigation by leveraging mid-level visual priors to enhance decision-making in dynamic environments. Traditional navigation systems often rely on low-level features or high-level semantic information, which can be computationally expensive or lack adaptability. In this work, we propose a novel approach that utilizes mid-level visual representations\u2014such as object affordances and spatial relationships\u2014to bridge the gap between perception and action. Our method integrates a deep learning framework with a probabilistic model to extract and interpret these priors, enabling the system to generalize across diverse scenarios. We evaluate the proposed approach on both simulated and real-world environments, demonstrating significant improvements in navigation accuracy and robustness compared to state-of-the-art baselines. The results highlight the effectiveness of mid-level priors in reducing computational overhead while maintaining high performance. This research contributes to the field of autonomous systems by introducing a scalable and interpretable navigation strategy, with potential applications in robotics, augmented reality, and assistive technologies.

{"text": "Uncertainty quantification (UQ) in classification tasks is critical for improving the reliability and interpretability of machine learning models, particularly in high-stakes applications such as healthcare and autonomous systems. This study addresses the challenge of accurately estimating predictive uncertainty in classification models, which is often overlooked or inadequately implemented. We propose a novel framework that integrates ensemble-based methods with advanced calibration techniques to enhance UQ in deep learning classifiers. Our approach leverages Monte Carlo Dropout and temperature scaling to improve uncertainty estimates while maintaining model performance. Experiments conducted on benchmark datasets, including CIFAR-10 and ImageNet, demonstrate that our method significantly reduces uncertainty estimation errors compared to existing approaches. Additionally, we introduce a new metric, *Uncertainty Calibration Error (UCE)*, to evaluate the reliability of uncertainty estimates. Results show that our framework achieves state-of-the-art performance in both classification accuracy and uncertainty calibration. The proposed method not only advances the field of UQ but also provides practical insights for deploying trustworthy AI systems in real-world scenarios. Key contributions include a robust framework for uncertainty-aware classification, a novel evaluation metric, and empirical validation across diverse datasets. This work has broad implications for improving the safety and reliability of AI-driven decision-making systems.  \n\n**Keywords**: Uncertainty Quantification, Classification, Deep Learning, Ensemble Methods, Model Calibration, Trustworthy AI."}

Traditional exploration methods often struggle with balancing the trade-off between revisiting known states and discovering new ones, leading to suboptimal learning performance. MADE addresses this challenge by explicitly maximizing the deviation of the agent\u2019s trajectory from previously explored regions, encouraging more diverse and efficient exploration. The proposed approach leverages a density-based model to estimate the exploration coverage and employs a deviation-maximization objective to guide the agent toward unexplored areas. Experiments conducted on benchmark environments, including high-dimensional continuous control tasks, demonstrate that MADE significantly outperforms existing exploration strategies in terms of sample efficiency and final performance. The results highlight the potential of MADE to improve RL applications in real-world scenarios where exploration is critical, such as robotics and autonomous systems.

{"text": "This paper introduces a novel approach to human pose estimation, demonstrating that 15 keypoints are sufficient to achieve state-of-the-art performance in various applications. Traditional methods often rely on complex models with a large number of keypoints, which can be computationally expensive and prone to overfitting. In contrast, our method leverages a streamlined architecture that focuses on 15 strategically selected keypoints, balancing accuracy and efficiency. We propose a lightweight deep learning model optimized for real-time processing, incorporating advanced techniques such as attention mechanisms and spatial-temporal modeling to enhance robustness. Experimental results on benchmark datasets show that our approach achieves comparable or superior accuracy to existing methods while significantly reducing computational overhead. Furthermore, the model demonstrates strong generalization capabilities across diverse environments and datasets. The findings suggest that reducing the number of keypoints does not compromise performance when combined with intelligent feature extraction and optimization strategies. This work has significant implications for applications requiring real-time pose estimation, such as augmented reality, robotics, and human-computer interaction, offering a practical and scalable solution. Keywords: human pose estimation, keypoints, deep learning, real-time processing, attention mechanisms."}

{"text": "Recommender systems play a pivotal role in enhancing user experience by providing personalized suggestions, with matrix factorization being a widely adopted technique. However, traditional matrix factorization methods often struggle with scalability and computational efficiency, especially when handling large datasets. This paper introduces a novel Block-based Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) approach to matrix factorization, designed to address these challenges. The proposed method partitions the user-item interaction matrix into smaller, manageable blocks, enabling parallel processing and reducing computational overhead. By leveraging SVD on these blocks, the approach maintains high accuracy while significantly improving scalability. Experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate that the Block-based SVD method outperforms conventional matrix factorization techniques in terms of both recommendation accuracy and computational efficiency. Furthermore, the approach exhibits robust performance across sparse and dense datasets, making it suitable for real-world applications. This research contributes to the field of recommender systems by offering a scalable and efficient solution that can be seamlessly integrated into existing frameworks. The findings highlight the potential of block-based strategies in advancing matrix factorization techniques, paving the way for more effective and resource-efficient recommender systems.  \n\n**Keywords**: Recommender systems, matrix factorization, Singular Value Decomposition (SVD), block-based processing, scalability, computational efficiency."}
{"text": "Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) target recognition under partial aspect angles poses significant challenges due to the limited and inconsistent information available in the observed data. This paper addresses the problem of recognizing SAR targets with incomplete aspect angles by proposing a novel Pose Discrepancy Spatial Transformer (PDST) framework for feature disentangling. The proposed approach leverages a spatial transformer mechanism to align and disentangle pose-invariant features from SAR images, enabling robust recognition even when only partial aspect angles are available. The PDST framework integrates a feature disentangling module that separates pose-specific and pose-agnostic representations, enhancing the model's ability to generalize across varying observation angles. Experimental results on benchmark SAR datasets demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms existing techniques in terms of recognition accuracy and robustness, particularly under challenging conditions with limited aspect angles. The findings highlight the effectiveness of the PDST framework in addressing pose discrepancies and improving SAR target recognition performance. This research contributes to advancing SAR-based recognition systems, with potential applications in remote sensing, surveillance, and defense.  \n\n**Keywords**: Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR), target recognition, partial aspect angles, spatial transformer, feature disentangling, pose discrepancy."}

{"text": "Low-rank matrix recovery is a fundamental problem in machine learning, signal processing, and data science, with applications ranging from recommendation systems to image processing. This paper addresses the challenge of achieving fast global convergence in low-rank matrix recovery using Riemannian gradient descent (RGD) with random initialization. While RGD is widely used for optimization on manifolds, its convergence properties often depend heavily on careful initialization, limiting its practicality. We propose a novel approach that leverages random initialization to achieve global convergence guarantees without requiring prior knowledge of the solution. Our method combines Riemannian optimization techniques with probabilistic analysis to demonstrate that RGD converges to the global optimum at a linear rate under mild assumptions. Theoretical results are supported by extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets, showing that the proposed approach outperforms existing methods in terms of both speed and accuracy. The key innovation lies in the proof of global convergence for RGD with random initialization, which significantly reduces the dependency on initialization quality. This work provides a robust and efficient framework for low-rank matrix recovery, with potential applications in large-scale data analysis and beyond.  \n\n**Keywords**: Low-rank matrix recovery, Riemannian gradient descent, global convergence, random initialization, optimization on manifolds."}

The objective of SHOP-VRB is to address the limitations of existing datasets by providing a comprehensive framework for evaluating the ability of machine learning models to reason about object properties, spatial relationships, and contextual interactions in complex visual environments. The benchmark comprises a diverse set of high-resolution images and associated tasks, including object recognition, attribute prediction, and relational reasoning. To develop SHOP-VRB, we employed a systematic data collection and annotation process, leveraging both synthetic and real-world datasets to ensure scalability and realism. We evaluated state-of-the-art deep learning models, including convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and transformer-based architectures, on SHOP-VRB, revealing significant performance gaps in tasks requiring fine-grained reasoning. Our results demonstrate that current models struggle with nuanced object perception, particularly in scenarios involving occlusions, varying lighting conditions, and complex object interactions. The findings highlight the need for more robust and interpretable visual reasoning systems. SHOP-VRB serves as a critical tool for advancing research in computer vision, offering a standardized platform for benchmarking and fostering innovation in object perception technologies.

{"text": "This paper introduces *Time-Travel Rephotography*, a novel framework for reconstructing and enhancing historical photographs using advanced deep learning techniques. The objective is to address the challenges of restoring degraded, low-resolution, or damaged historical images while preserving their authenticity and contextual details. We propose a hybrid approach combining generative adversarial networks (GANs) with temporal consistency modeling to reconstruct missing or corrupted regions and enhance image quality. Our method leverages multi-scale feature extraction and attention mechanisms to ensure high-fidelity restoration, even for images with significant degradation. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed framework outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in terms of visual quality, structural preservation, and temporal coherence. The system achieves a 15% improvement in peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) and a 20% reduction in perceptual loss compared to baseline models. The implications of this research extend to digital archiving, cultural heritage preservation, and media restoration, offering a powerful tool for reconstructing historical visuals with unprecedented accuracy.

{"text": "Optimal Transport (OT) has emerged as a powerful framework for solving large-scale distribution alignment problems in machine learning and data science. However, scaling OT to high-dimensional datasets remains computationally challenging due to its inherent complexity. This paper introduces a novel approach to large-scale OT by leveraging adversarial training with cycle-consistency constraints. Our method combines the strengths of generative adversarial networks (GANs) and cycle-consistent adversarial networks (CycleGANs) to approximate OT solutions efficiently. Specifically, we propose a dual-network architecture that learns mappings between source and target distributions while enforcing cycle-consistency to ensure bi-directional alignment. Through extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets, we demonstrate that our approach achieves competitive performance in terms of computational efficiency and alignment accuracy compared to traditional OT solvers. Furthermore, the proposed method exhibits robustness to high-dimensional data and scalability to large datasets, making it suitable for applications such as domain adaptation, image-to-image translation, and generative modeling. Our work contributes a practical and scalable framework for OT, bridging the gap between theoretical foundations and real-world applications.  \n\n**Keywords**: Optimal Transport, Adversarial Training, Cycle-Consistency, Generative Adversarial Networks, Domain Adaptation, Scalability."}
{"text": "Causal discovery is a fundamental challenge in machine learning and artificial intelligence, with applications spanning healthcare, economics, and beyond. Traditional methods for causal discovery often rely on enforcing acyclicity constraints to ensure valid causal structures, which can be computationally expensive and limit scalability. This paper introduces a novel approach for efficient neural causal discovery that eliminates the need for explicit acyclicity constraints. Our method leverages a differentiable framework to model causal relationships directly, enabling faster and more scalable learning of causal graphs. By reformulating the problem, we avoid the computational bottlenecks associated with traditional acyclicity checks while maintaining the integrity of the discovered causal structures. Experimental results on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that our approach achieves competitive accuracy in causal discovery tasks while significantly reducing computational overhead. The proposed method also shows robustness in handling high-dimensional data, making it suitable for large-scale applications. This work contributes a practical and efficient solution to causal discovery, paving the way for broader adoption in real-world scenarios where computational efficiency is critical.  \n\n**Keywords**: causal discovery, neural networks, acyclicity constraints, scalability, differentiable models, machine learning."}

{"text": "Reinforcement Learning (RL) has shown remarkable success in various domains, yet its performance often degrades when deployed in environments that deviate from the training model. This paper addresses the critical challenge of RL under model mismatch, where discrepancies between the training and deployment environments lead to suboptimal or unsafe policies. We propose a novel framework that integrates robust optimization techniques with adaptive RL algorithms to mitigate the impact of model mismatch. Our approach leverages uncertainty quantification and domain adaptation to dynamically adjust policies during deployment, ensuring robustness across varying environmental conditions. Experimental results on benchmark environments demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms traditional RL approaches in terms of stability and performance under model mismatch. The proposed framework not only enhances the reliability of RL systems in real-world applications but also provides a foundation for future research in adaptive and robust learning. Key contributions include a scalable algorithm for uncertainty-aware RL and empirical validation of its effectiveness in diverse scenarios. This work has broad implications for deploying RL in safety-critical systems, such as autonomous driving and robotics, where model mismatch is a prevalent concern.  \n\n**Keywords**: Reinforcement Learning, Model Mismatch, Robust Optimization, Uncertainty Quantification, Domain Adaptation, Adaptive Algorithms."}

{"text": "This paper investigates the vulnerability of deep learning-based semantic segmentation and object detection systems to adversarial examples, a critical concern in the deployment of robust computer vision models. The objective is to explore how subtle, intentionally crafted perturbations in input images can mislead state-of-the-art segmentation and detection models, leading to incorrect predictions. We propose a novel adversarial attack framework that leverages gradient-based optimization techniques to generate adversarial examples specifically tailored for these tasks. Our approach targets both pixel-level segmentation accuracy and bounding box localization, ensuring a comprehensive evaluation of model robustness. Experimental results on benchmark datasets, such as Cityscapes and COCO, demonstrate that even highly accurate models are susceptible to these attacks, with significant drops in performance metrics like mean Intersection-over-Union (mIoU) and Average Precision (AP). Furthermore, we analyze the transferability of adversarial examples across different architectures and tasks, revealing insights into the shared vulnerabilities of these systems. The findings underscore the need for improved defense mechanisms and highlight the potential risks of deploying such models in safety-critical applications like autonomous driving and surveillance. This work contributes to the growing body of research on adversarial robustness, offering a deeper understanding of the challenges and paving the way for more resilient computer vision systems.  \n\n**Keywords**: adversarial examples, semantic segmentation, object detection, deep learning, computer vision, robustness, transferability."}
{"text": "This paper explores the application of quasi-Newton optimization methods in deep learning, addressing the challenges of training complex neural networks efficiently. Traditional gradient-based optimization techniques, such as stochastic gradient descent (SGD), often suffer from slow convergence and sensitivity to hyperparameters. Quasi-Newton methods, known for their ability to approximate second-order information, offer a promising alternative by leveraging curvature information to accelerate convergence. In this study, we investigate the integration of quasi-Newton algorithms, including L-BFGS and its variants, into deep learning frameworks. We evaluate their performance on benchmark datasets and compare them with standard optimization techniques in terms of convergence speed, accuracy, and computational efficiency. Our results demonstrate that quasi-Newton methods can significantly reduce training time while maintaining or improving model accuracy, particularly in scenarios with high-dimensional parameter spaces. The findings highlight the potential of these methods to enhance the scalability and efficiency of deep learning applications, offering a robust alternative to conventional optimization approaches. This research contributes to the growing body of work on advanced optimization techniques for machine learning, providing insights into their practical implementation and benefits.  \n\n**Keywords**: quasi-Newton methods, deep learning, optimization, L-BFGS, neural networks, convergence acceleration."}

{"text": "This paper introduces *Deep Decoder*, a novel approach for generating concise image representations using untrained, non-convolutional neural networks. The primary objective is to explore the potential of simple, untrained architectures in producing high-quality image reconstructions and representations without relying on traditional convolutional layers or extensive training datasets. Unlike conventional methods that require large-scale training and complex architectures, Deep Decoder leverages the inherent structure of non-convolutional networks to achieve efficient image compression and reconstruction. The proposed method is evaluated on standard image datasets, demonstrating competitive performance in terms of reconstruction quality and computational efficiency. Results indicate that Deep Decoder can produce visually appealing reconstructions while significantly reducing the number of parameters and computational overhead compared to state-of-the-art convolutional models. This work highlights the potential of untrained networks in image processing tasks and opens new avenues for research in lightweight, efficient image representation techniques.

{"text": "The discovery of novel crystallographic structures is a critical challenge in materials science, with significant implications for energy storage, catalysis, and semiconductor technologies. Traditional methods for structure prediction are computationally intensive and often limited by the complexity of the search space. This paper introduces CrystalGAN, a novel framework leveraging Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to autonomously discover and generate stable crystallographic structures. CrystalGAN employs a dual-network architecture, where a generator network proposes candidate structures, and a discriminator network evaluates their stability and feasibility based on crystallographic principles. The model is trained on a diverse dataset of known crystal structures, enabling it to learn the underlying patterns and constraints of stable configurations. Experimental results demonstrate that CrystalGAN outperforms existing methods in generating physically plausible and energetically favorable structures, achieving a 15% improvement in prediction accuracy compared to state-of-the-art approaches. Furthermore, the framework successfully identifies several previously unknown crystal phases, validated through density functional theory (DFT) calculations. CrystalGAN represents a significant advancement in computational materials discovery, offering a scalable and efficient tool for accelerating the design of next-generation materials.  \n\n**Keywords**: Generative Adversarial Networks, Crystallography, Materials Discovery, Machine Learning, Crystal Structure Prediction."}

{"text": "Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) are widely used for sequential data analysis, but accurately aligning and comparing states across different models remains a challenge. This paper introduces a novel framework that combines the Aggregated Wasserstein Metric (AWM) with state registration techniques to improve the alignment and comparison of HMM states. The proposed approach leverages the Wasserstein distance to measure the similarity between probability distributions of states, while state registration ensures consistent mapping of states across models. Our method is evaluated on both synthetic and real-world datasets, demonstrating superior performance in state alignment and model comparison compared to traditional methods. The results show that the AWM-based approach achieves higher accuracy in identifying state correspondences and provides a robust framework for analyzing HMMs with varying structures.

{"text": "This paper presents a novel self-supervised approach for estimating optical flow based on facial movements, addressing the challenges of accurately capturing subtle and dynamic facial expressions. Traditional optical flow methods often rely on supervised learning with labeled datasets, which are labor-intensive to create and may lack generalizability. To overcome these limitations, we propose a self-supervised framework that leverages facial motion patterns and temporal consistency to train a deep neural network without requiring ground truth annotations. Our method incorporates a combination of spatial and temporal constraints, enabling the model to learn robust representations of facial movements from unlabeled video sequences. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art supervised methods on benchmark datasets, while significantly reducing the dependency on labeled data. Additionally, the model shows strong generalization capabilities across diverse facial expressions and lighting conditions. This work contributes to advancing optical flow estimation in facial analysis, with potential applications in emotion recognition, animation, and human-computer interaction. Key innovations include the integration of self-supervised learning with facial motion dynamics and the ability to handle complex, non-rigid facial deformations.

{"text": "Fine-grained image captioning aims to generate detailed and contextually accurate descriptions of images, a task that remains challenging due to the need for precise alignment between visual and textual elements. This paper introduces a novel approach to fine-grained image captioning by proposing a Global-Local Discriminative Objective (GLDO) that enhances the model's ability to capture both global scene context and local object details. The GLDO framework integrates a dual-path architecture, where one path focuses on global image understanding and the other emphasizes local object-level features. By leveraging a discriminative loss function, the model is trained to distinguish between relevant and irrelevant visual-textual associations, improving the accuracy and specificity of generated captions. Experiments conducted on benchmark datasets, such as MS-COCO and Flickr30k, demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms existing state-of-the-art models in terms of both caption quality and fine-grained detail preservation. The results highlight the effectiveness of the GLDO in bridging the gap between global and local visual understanding, offering significant improvements in image captioning tasks. This work contributes to advancing fine-grained image understanding and has potential applications in areas such as assistive technologies, content-based image retrieval, and automated media annotation.  \n\n**Keywords**: Fine-grained image captioning, global-local discriminative objective, dual-path architecture, visual-textual alignment, image understanding."}

{"text": "Blind face restoration is a challenging task in computer vision, aiming to recover high-quality facial images from severely degraded inputs without prior knowledge of the degradation process. This paper presents a novel deep learning-based approach for blind face restoration by leveraging multi-scale component dictionaries. Our method decomposes facial images into multiple scales and components, such as eyes, nose, and mouth, and learns specialized dictionaries for each component to capture fine-grained details. A multi-scale generative adversarial network (GAN) is employed to reconstruct the face, ensuring both global consistency and local fidelity. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of visual quality and structural similarity, particularly for images with heavy noise, blur, or low resolution. The proposed framework also shows robustness across diverse datasets and real-world scenarios. This work contributes to advancing blind face restoration by introducing a component-aware, multi-scale dictionary learning strategy, offering potential applications in surveillance, forensics, and digital media enhancement.  \n\n**Keywords**: Blind face restoration, multi-scale dictionaries, generative adversarial networks (GANs), deep learning, computer vision."}

{"text": "The accurate representation of medical images is critical for tasks such as diagnosis, segmentation, and classification. However, existing methods often rely on supervised learning, which requires extensive labeled datasets that are costly and time-consuming to acquire. This paper proposes a novel unsupervised learning framework for extracting local discriminative representations from medical images. The approach leverages a self-supervised contrastive learning mechanism to capture fine-grained local features without the need for manual annotations. By employing a multi-scale feature extraction network and a region-aware clustering algorithm, the method effectively identifies and encodes discriminative patterns within medical images. Experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed framework outperforms state-of-the-art unsupervised methods in terms of feature discriminability and downstream task performance, such as disease classification and anomaly detection. The findings highlight the potential of unsupervised learning in reducing dependency on labeled data while maintaining high accuracy in medical image analysis. This work contributes to advancing unsupervised representation learning in healthcare applications, offering a scalable and efficient solution for medical image understanding.  \n\n**Keywords**: unsupervised learning, medical image analysis, discriminative representation, contrastive learning, self-supervised learning, feature extraction."}
{"text": "This paper addresses the challenge of textual editing in images, a task that involves modifying or replacing text within an image while preserving its visual coherence and context. The objective is to develop a robust framework capable of understanding and manipulating textual elements in multimodal (text-image) data. To achieve this, we propose a novel approach that leverages multimodal affinities, combining advanced computer vision techniques with natural language processing (NLP) to align and edit textual content seamlessly. Our method employs a deep learning model trained on a diverse dataset of text-image pairs, enabling it to learn contextual relationships between visual and textual modalities. The model incorporates attention mechanisms to prioritize relevant image regions and text features, ensuring accurate and context-aware edits. Experimental results demonstrate significant improvements in text editing accuracy and visual quality compared to existing methods, particularly in complex scenarios involving varied fonts, backgrounds, and layouts. The proposed framework also exhibits strong generalization capabilities across diverse datasets. This research contributes to the growing field of multimodal learning by introducing a scalable and efficient solution for textual editing in images, with potential applications in document processing, augmented reality, and content creation.  \n\n**Keywords**: Textual editing, multimodal learning, computer vision, natural language processing, deep learning, attention mechanisms."}
{"text": "Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) is a powerful framework for solving problems where data is organized into bags of instances, with labels assigned at the bag level rather than the instance level. This paper investigates the impact of different pooling filters on the performance of MIL tasks, aiming to identify optimal strategies for aggregating instance-level predictions into bag-level outputs. We evaluate a range of pooling methods, including max pooling, mean pooling, and attention-based mechanisms, across diverse datasets and MIL applications. Our experiments demonstrate that the choice of pooling filter significantly influences model accuracy, robustness, and interpretability. Attention-based pooling, in particular, emerges as a superior approach, offering both competitive performance and enhanced insights into instance contributions. The findings provide actionable guidelines for selecting pooling strategies in MIL frameworks, with implications for applications in medical imaging, text classification, and beyond. This study contributes to the broader understanding of MIL by highlighting the critical role of pooling filters and proposing a systematic evaluation methodology for future research.  \n\n**Keywords**: Multiple Instance Learning, pooling filters, attention mechanisms, instance aggregation, machine learning, interpretability."}

This paper addresses the challenge of training denoising models in the absence of such ground truth data. We propose a novel self-supervised learning framework that leverages noisy observations to train deep denoising networks effectively. Our approach utilizes a combination of noise modeling and iterative refinement techniques to estimate clean signals directly from noisy inputs, eliminating the need for paired clean-noisy datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves competitive performance compared to supervised approaches, even when ground truth data is unavailable.

{"text": "Unsupervised transfer learning has emerged as a critical approach for leveraging knowledge from unlabeled source domains to improve performance in target domains. However, the challenge of identifying and prioritizing relevant features across domains remains a significant bottleneck. This paper introduces an **Adaptive Feature Ranking (AFR)** framework designed to address this issue by dynamically evaluating and ranking features based on their domain relevance and discriminative power. The proposed method employs a novel **unsupervised feature evaluation mechanism** that integrates clustering-based similarity measures and entropy-based feature importance scoring. By iteratively refining feature rankings, AFR ensures optimal feature selection for domain adaptation without requiring labeled data. Experiments conducted on benchmark datasets demonstrate that AFR outperforms existing unsupervised transfer learning methods, achieving an average improvement of **12.5%** in classification accuracy. Furthermore, the framework exhibits robustness across diverse domains, including image recognition, text classification, and sensor data analysis. The results highlight the potential of AFR to enhance the efficiency and scalability of unsupervised transfer learning systems, paving the way for broader applications in real-world scenarios where labeled data is scarce.  \n\n**Keywords**: Unsupervised Transfer Learning, Feature Ranking, Domain Adaptation, Clustering, Entropy, Feature Selection."}

{"text": "Understanding brain activity through functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) data is a critical challenge in neuroscience and artificial intelligence. This paper introduces a novel **Dynamic Adaptive Spatio-temporal Graph Convolution (DAST-GC)** model to address the complexities of fMRI data analysis. The proposed approach leverages graph-based representations to capture both spatial and temporal dependencies in brain networks, enabling more accurate modeling of dynamic neural interactions.

{"text": "Heterogeneous multigraphs, which consist of multiple node and edge types, are increasingly prevalent in complex systems such as social networks, knowledge graphs, and biological networks. However, embedding such structures into low-dimensional spaces while preserving their rich semantic and topological information remains a significant challenge. This paper introduces *Het-node2vec*, a novel framework for embedding heterogeneous multigraphs by leveraging second-order random walk sampling. The proposed approach extends the traditional node2vec algorithm to handle heterogeneous and multi-relational data, enabling the capture of both local and global structural patterns across diverse node and edge types. By incorporating a biased random walk strategy, *Het-node2vec* effectively balances the exploration of homophily and structural equivalence in heterogeneous contexts. Experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that *Het-node2vec* outperforms existing methods in tasks such as node classification, link prediction, and clustering, achieving superior accuracy and scalability. The framework\u2019s ability to model complex relationships in heterogeneous multigraphs opens new avenues for applications in recommendation systems, knowledge graph completion, and network analysis. This work contributes a robust and flexible tool for embedding heterogeneous multigraphs, addressing a critical gap in graph representation learning.  \n\n**Keywords**: heterogeneous multigraphs, graph embedding, random walk sampling, node2vec, network analysis, representation learning."}

This paper introduces BBQ-Networks, a novel deep reinforcement learning (DRL) framework designed to enhance exploration efficiency in TODS. The proposed approach leverages a Bayesian Bootstrapped Q-Network architecture, which integrates uncertainty estimation into the Q-learning process to guide exploration more effectively. By modeling uncertainty over action values, BBQ-Networks dynamically prioritize under-explored states and actions, reducing redundant exploration and accelerating policy convergence. Experiments conducted on benchmark dialogue datasets demonstrate that BBQ-Networks outperform traditional DRL methods, achieving higher task success rates with fewer training iterations. Additionally, the framework exhibits robust performance in scenarios with sparse rewards and large action spaces, making it particularly suitable for real-world dialogue applications. The results highlight the potential of BBQ-Networks to advance the development of more efficient and adaptive task-oriented dialogue systems, with implications for improving user experience and system scalability.  \n\n**Keywords**: Deep Reinforcement Learning, Task-Oriented Dialogue Systems, Exploration Efficiency, Bayesian Bootstrapping, Q-Networks, Uncertainty Estimation."}

{"text": "This paper addresses the challenge of modeling local information agents in partially-observable environments, a critical problem in artificial intelligence and multi-agent systems. The objective is to develop a robust framework that enables agents to make informed decisions with limited access to global information, focusing on improving adaptability and efficiency in dynamic settings. We propose a novel approach combining reinforcement learning with probabilistic graphical models to enhance the agent's ability to infer and act upon local observations. The methodology integrates a decentralized decision-making mechanism, allowing agents to update their beliefs and strategies in real-time while maintaining computational feasibility. Experimental results demonstrate significant improvements in task completion rates and resource utilization compared to traditional methods, particularly in scenarios with high uncertainty and sparse data. The findings highlight the framework's ability to balance exploration and exploitation, leading to more effective agent coordination and performance. This research contributes to advancing the design of intelligent systems for applications such as autonomous robotics, distributed sensor networks, and real-time decision support systems. Key innovations include the integration of probabilistic reasoning with learning-based strategies, offering a scalable solution for partially-observable environments. Keywords: local information agents, partially-observable environments, reinforcement learning, probabilistic graphical models, decentralized decision-making."}

{"text": "This paper addresses the challenge of anomaly detection in particulate matter (PM) sensors, which are critical for monitoring air quality. Traditional methods often struggle with high-dimensional data and complex patterns, leading to reduced accuracy and efficiency. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel approach using a Hypothesis Pruning Generative Adversarial Network (HP-GAN). The HP-GAN framework integrates a hypothesis pruning mechanism into the GAN architecture, enabling the model to focus on relevant features while discarding redundant or noisy data. This enhances the model's ability to detect anomalies in PM sensor data with higher precision.  \n\nOur experiments demonstrate that the HP-GAN outperforms existing anomaly detection methods in terms of accuracy, recall, and computational efficiency. The model achieves a 15% improvement in anomaly detection accuracy compared to state-of-the-art techniques, while reducing false positives by 20%. Additionally, the hypothesis pruning mechanism significantly reduces training time, making the approach scalable for real-time applications.  \n\nThe proposed method has significant implications for environmental monitoring systems, enabling more reliable and efficient detection of sensor malfunctions or data anomalies. This research contributes to the advancement of anomaly detection in IoT-based sensor networks, offering a robust solution for improving air quality monitoring systems.  \n\n**Keywords**: Anomaly detection, particulate matter sensors, generative adversarial networks, hypothesis pruning, air quality monitoring, IoT."}

This paper introduces R2N2 (Residual Recurrent Neural Networks), a novel deep learning architecture designed to enhance the accuracy and robustness of forecasting models. The proposed approach integrates residual connections with recurrent neural networks (RNNs) to address the vanishing gradient problem and improve the learning of long-term dependencies in sequential data. R2N2 leverages stacked layers of gated recurrent units (GRUs) with skip connections, enabling more efficient gradient flow and capturing complex temporal patterns. Experiments were conducted on multiple benchmark datasets, including energy consumption and stock price prediction tasks. Results demonstrate that R2N2 outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving significant improvements in prediction accuracy and computational efficiency. The model's ability to handle high-dimensional data and its scalability make it a promising solution for real-world applications.

{"text": "Accurate long-term municipal water demand forecasting is critical for sustainable water resource management and infrastructure planning. This study addresses the challenge of predicting water demand over extended periods using univariate time series data. We propose a novel forecasting framework that combines advanced machine learning techniques with traditional statistical methods to improve prediction accuracy. Specifically, the approach integrates Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural networks with seasonal decomposition and autoregressive modeling to capture complex temporal patterns and dependencies in water consumption data. The model is trained and validated using historical water demand data from a major metropolitan area, demonstrating superior performance compared to conventional methods such as ARIMA and exponential smoothing. Key findings reveal that the proposed framework achieves a significant reduction in forecasting error, particularly in capturing seasonal variations and long-term trends. The results highlight the potential of hybrid models in enhancing the reliability of long-term water demand forecasts, offering valuable insights for policymakers and urban planners. This research contributes to the field by introducing a robust, data-driven solution for univariate water demand forecasting, with implications for improving water resource allocation and infrastructure resilience in rapidly urbanizing regions.  \n\n**Keywords**: water demand forecasting, univariate time series, LSTM, machine learning, urban planning, resource management."}

{"text": "This paper introduces *Pose Proposal Critic* (PPC), a novel framework for robust 3D pose refinement by learning reprojection errors. The objective of this work is to address the challenge of accurately refining 3D pose estimates in scenarios with noisy or incomplete data, which is critical for applications such as augmented reality, robotics, and 3D reconstruction. Traditional methods often rely on handcrafted error metrics or iterative optimization, which can be sensitive to outliers and fail to generalize across diverse scenarios. To overcome these limitations, PPC employs a data-driven approach, leveraging a deep neural network to predict reprojection errors directly from pose proposals. The proposed method integrates a pose proposal generator with a critic network trained to evaluate and refine poses based on learned reprojection error patterns. Experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that PPC significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of accuracy and robustness, particularly in challenging conditions with occlusions and sparse inputs. The framework\u2019s ability to generalize across different datasets and its computational efficiency make it a practical solution for real-world applications. This research contributes a new perspective on pose refinement by shifting from traditional optimization to learning-based error modeling, paving the way for more reliable and adaptive pose estimation systems.  \n\n**Keywords**: 3D pose refinement, reprojection error, deep learning, pose estimation, neural networks, robust optimization."}
{"text": "In the rapidly evolving landscape of adversarial machine learning, the challenge of creating robust and transparent attack methodologies remains critical. This paper addresses two key limitations in adversarial patch attacks: distributional shift and obtrusiveness. While existing patch-based attacks often fail to generalize across diverse datasets or require highly conspicuous modifications, we propose a novel framework that enhances both effectiveness and transparency. Our approach leverages adaptive patch generation techniques, integrating domain adaptation principles to mitigate distributional shifts, while employing perceptual loss functions to minimize visual obtrusiveness. Through extensive experiments on benchmark datasets, we demonstrate that our method achieves superior attack success rates across varying data distributions, outperforming state-of-the-art approaches by up to 15%. Additionally, qualitative evaluations confirm that the generated patches are significantly less detectable by human observers, striking a balance between stealth and efficacy. The implications of this work extend to improving the robustness of machine learning models against real-world adversarial threats, while also raising awareness of the need for transparent and adaptive defense mechanisms. This research contributes to the broader discourse on trustworthy AI by addressing critical vulnerabilities in a manner that prioritizes both performance and practicality.  \n\n**Keywords**: adversarial attacks, patch attacks, distributional shift, obtrusiveness, transparent AI, domain adaptation, perceptual loss."}

{"text": "Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection is a critical challenge in deploying deep learning models in real-world applications, where models must reliably identify inputs that deviate from their training data. Despite the growing use of deep generative models (DGMs) for OOD detection, their performance often falls short of expectations, leading to potential risks in safety-critical systems. This paper investigates the underlying causes of these failures and proposes a systematic framework to analyze and improve OOD detection capabilities in DGMs. We evaluate several state-of-the-art DGMs, including Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) and Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), across diverse datasets and OOD scenarios. Our findings reveal that common failure modes stem from limitations in model calibration, overconfidence in generated samples, and insufficient separation between in-distribution and OOD data in latent spaces. To address these issues, we introduce a novel regularization technique that enhances the discriminative power of DGMs for OOD detection. Experimental results demonstrate significant improvements in detection accuracy, with our approach outperforming existing methods by up to 15% on benchmark datasets. This research provides valuable insights into the challenges of OOD detection with DGMs and offers practical solutions to enhance their reliability in real-world applications.  \n\n**Keywords**: Out-of-distribution detection, deep generative models, VAEs, GANs, model calibration, regularization, latent space analysis."}
{"text": "Low light image enhancement is a critical challenge in computer vision, with applications ranging from surveillance to medical imaging. This paper addresses the problem of improving image quality under low-light conditions by proposing a novel approach that leverages both global and local context modeling. The proposed method integrates a dual-branch architecture, where one branch captures global illumination characteristics and the other focuses on fine-grained local details. By combining these complementary features, the model achieves a balanced enhancement of brightness, contrast, and texture. The approach employs a lightweight neural network optimized for efficiency, making it suitable for real-time applications. Experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate significant improvements in both quantitative metrics (e.g., PSNR, SSIM) and qualitative visual assessments compared to state-of-the-art methods. The proposed method also exhibits robustness across diverse lighting conditions and noise levels. This research contributes a scalable and effective solution for low light image enhancement, with potential applications in autonomous vehicles, security systems, and mobile photography.  \n\n**Keywords**: low light image enhancement, global context modeling, local context modeling, neural networks, computer vision, real-time processing."}

However, object detection in UAV images remains challenging due to varying scales, orientations, and complex backgrounds. This paper introduces **SyNet**, an ensemble network designed to address these challenges by leveraging the strengths of multiple deep learning architectures. The proposed approach integrates feature extraction from state-of-the-art convolutional neural networks (CNNs) with a novel fusion mechanism to enhance detection accuracy across diverse object sizes and orientations. SyNet employs a multi-scale feature pyramid network (FPN) to capture fine-grained details and a self-attention module to prioritize relevant regions in cluttered scenes. Experiments were conducted on benchmark UAV datasets, demonstrating that SyNet achieves superior performance compared to existing methods, with significant improvements in precision and recall. The results highlight the network's robustness to scale variations and complex backgrounds, making it a promising solution for real-world UAV applications.

{"text": "The increasing reliance on machine learning classifiers in decision-making systems has raised concerns about bias, particularly when these systems are deployed in real-world scenarios. This study investigates the discrepancy between expected and real-world performance of debiasing techniques in classifiers, focusing on whether theoretical assumptions align with practical outcomes. We evaluate several state-of-the-art debiasing methods, including adversarial training, reweighting, and data augmentation, across diverse datasets and real-world applications. Our experiments reveal that while these techniques effectively reduce bias in controlled environments, their performance often degrades in real-world settings due to factors such as dataset shift, incomplete bias definitions, and evolving societal norms. We propose a novel evaluation framework that incorporates dynamic bias metrics and real-world constraints to better assess debiasing effectiveness. Results demonstrate that our framework provides a more accurate representation of classifier performance, highlighting the need for debiasing approaches that account for real-world variability. This research contributes to the field by emphasizing the importance of aligning theoretical expectations with practical realities, offering insights for developing more robust and equitable machine learning systems.  \n\n**Keywords**: debiasing, machine learning, fairness, adversarial training, dataset shift, real-world performance."}

We propose a novel refinement framework that leverages a combination of deep learning-based generative models and geometric optimization techniques. The approach begins with an initial prediction of missing regions using a state-of-the-art point cloud completion network, followed by a refinement module that iteratively improves the predicted geometry by aligning it with the observed data and enforcing structural consistency. Experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate that our method achieves significant improvements in completion accuracy and visual quality compared to existing approaches.

{"text": "Continuous-Time Bayesian Networks (CTBNs) are powerful probabilistic models for reasoning about dynamic systems evolving over continuous time. However, traditional CTBNs often assume that all processes evolve at the same rate, limiting their applicability to real-world scenarios where processes operate under varying temporal dynamics. This paper introduces Continuous-Time Bayesian Networks with Clocks (CTBN-C), a novel extension of CTBNs that incorporates explicit clock mechanisms to model heterogeneous temporal behaviors. The proposed approach leverages a hierarchical framework to represent and infer the rates of individual processes, enabling more accurate and flexible modeling of complex systems. We present an efficient inference algorithm based on variational methods to handle the increased computational complexity introduced by the clock mechanisms. Experimental results on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that CTBN-C outperforms traditional CTBNs in capturing temporal heterogeneity, achieving significant improvements in predictive accuracy and model interpretability. The proposed framework has broad applications in domains such as healthcare, finance, and robotics, where understanding and predicting asynchronous processes is critical. This work advances the state-of-the-art in continuous-time probabilistic modeling by addressing a key limitation of existing approaches and providing a scalable solution for real-world applications.  \n\n**Keywords**: Continuous-Time Bayesian Networks, probabilistic modeling, temporal heterogeneity, clock mechanisms, variational inference, dynamic systems."}

Unlike traditional convolutional or recurrent layers, the proposed method is lightweight, flexible, and can be integrated into existing architectures with minimal computational overhead. We evaluate the effectiveness of our approach on benchmark datasets for video classification, object detection, and segmentation tasks. Experimental results demonstrate significant performance improvements over state-of-the-art methods, with gains in accuracy and robustness. The proposed non-local operation also exhibits strong generalization capabilities across diverse domains, making it a versatile tool for modern deep learning applications. This work contributes a scalable and efficient framework for capturing global dependencies, paving the way for advancements in tasks requiring comprehensive contextual understanding.  \n\n**Keywords**: non-local neural networks, long-range dependencies, global interactions, video analysis, deep learning, object detection, segmentation."}

{"text": "This paper addresses the challenge of multi-object detection and tracking in environments where visual data alone is insufficient or unreliable, such as low-light conditions or occluded scenes. We propose a novel self-supervised framework that leverages multimodal knowledge, specifically integrating sound and visual data, to enhance object detection and tracking accuracy. Our approach employs a teacher-student distillation model, where the teacher network is trained on multimodal data (audio-visual pairs) to learn robust representations, while the student network is trained using only visual data, guided by the teacher's knowledge. This enables the student to implicitly incorporate auditory cues into its visual processing pipeline. We evaluate our method on benchmark datasets, demonstrating significant improvements in detection and tracking performance compared to state-of-the-art visual-only methods. The results highlight the effectiveness of distilling multimodal knowledge into a single modality, particularly in challenging scenarios. This work contributes to advancing self-supervised learning in multimodal environments and has potential applications in robotics, surveillance, and autonomous systems, where robust perception under diverse conditions is critical.  \n\n**Keywords**: self-supervised learning, multimodal knowledge distillation, object detection, object tracking, audio-visual learning, computer vision."}

The objective is to mitigate biases in regression tasks while maintaining predictive accuracy, ensuring fairness across sensitive attributes such as gender, race, or socioeconomic status. We propose a unified approach that integrates fairness constraints directly into the regression model, leveraging optimization techniques to balance fairness and performance. Our method is flexible, supporting various fairness definitions, including demographic parity and equalized odds, and is applicable to a wide range of regression problems. Experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed framework achieves competitive predictive accuracy while significantly reducing bias compared to existing methods. The findings highlight the framework's robustness and adaptability, making it suitable for real-world applications such as healthcare, finance, and hiring systems.

The objective is to develop a model that mimics the expertise of sonographers, who rely on specific visual cues to identify critical anatomical structures and anomalies. We propose a novel deep learning framework that integrates visual attention modeling with ultrasound image analysis. The approach employs a dual-branch neural network architecture, where one branch processes raw ultrasound images, and the other learns to predict sonographer gaze patterns using eye-tracking data. The model is trained on a curated dataset of ultrasound scans paired with corresponding gaze maps, enabling it to focus on diagnostically relevant regions. Experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms traditional image representation techniques in downstream tasks such as classification and segmentation, achieving higher accuracy and interpretability. The findings highlight the potential of incorporating human expertise into machine learning models for medical imaging. This research contributes to the development of more reliable and efficient diagnostic tools, with implications for improving patient outcomes and reducing the workload of medical professionals. Key innovations include the integration of visual attention mechanisms and the use of gaze data to guide model training.

{"text": "Scene Text Recognition (STR) is a critical task in computer vision, enabling the extraction of textual information from images. However, many existing STR models heavily rely on vocabulary-based constraints, which can limit their generalization to diverse and unseen text instances. This paper investigates the extent of vocabulary reliance in STR systems and proposes a novel approach to reduce dependency on predefined lexicons while maintaining high recognition accuracy. We introduce a hybrid model that combines deep learning-based feature extraction with a context-aware decoding mechanism, enabling robust recognition of both in-vocabulary and out-of-vocabulary text. Our experiments demonstrate that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance on benchmark datasets, with significant improvements in handling rare and complex text instances. The findings highlight the importance of reducing vocabulary bias in STR systems and provide insights into developing more adaptable and generalizable models for real-world applications. This research contributes to advancing STR technology by offering a scalable solution for diverse text recognition scenarios, with potential applications in document analysis, autonomous systems, and augmented reality.  \n\n**Keywords**: Scene Text Recognition, Vocabulary Reliance, Deep Learning, Context-Aware Decoding, Out-of-Vocabulary Text, Computer Vision."}

This paper presents a novel approach leveraging Meta Reinforcement Learning (Meta-RL) to bridge the sim-to-real gap effectively. The objective is to develop a robust framework that enables agents to adapt quickly and efficiently to real-world conditions with minimal additional training. Our method employs a meta-learning strategy that pre-trains agents on diverse simulated environments, enabling them to generalize across varying dynamics and conditions. The approach integrates a combination of task-specific adaptation and meta-optimization to enhance transferability. Experimental results demonstrate significant improvements in real-world task performance compared to traditional reinforcement learning methods, with reduced reliance on extensive real-world data. The proposed framework achieves up to 30% higher success rates in robotic manipulation tasks and exhibits superior adaptability to unseen environments. This research contributes a scalable and efficient solution for sim-to-real transfer, with potential applications in robotics, autonomous systems, and industrial automation. Key innovations include the integration of meta-learning principles with domain randomization techniques, enabling faster and more reliable adaptation.

{"text": "Diabetes management relies heavily on accurate glucose prediction to enable timely interventions and improve patient outcomes. This study focuses on interpreting deep learning models for glucose prediction in diabetic individuals using the RETAIN (REverse Time AttentIoN) architecture. The objective is to enhance the transparency and interpretability of predictive models, which are often criticized for their \"black-box\" nature. We employ RETAIN, a clinically inspired deep learning model, to predict future glucose levels based on historical electronic health records (EHRs) and continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) data. The model leverages attention mechanisms to identify critical temporal patterns and feature contributions, enabling clinicians to understand the reasoning behind predictions. Our experiments demonstrate that RETAIN achieves competitive prediction accuracy while providing interpretable insights into the factors influencing glucose fluctuations. Key findings reveal that temporal dependencies and specific health events, such as medication intake and physical activity, significantly impact glucose levels. The interpretability of the model facilitates trust and adoption in clinical settings, offering a valuable tool for personalized diabetes management. This research contributes to the growing field of explainable AI in healthcare, emphasizing the importance of interpretability in predictive models for chronic disease management.  \n\n**Keywords**: glucose prediction, diabetes management, RETAIN, interpretable AI, deep learning, electronic health records, continuous glucose monitoring."}

{"text": "This paper addresses the challenge of generating a *doppelganger graph*\u2014a graph that closely resembles a given target graph in structure and properties but remains distinct in its underlying topology. The objective is to create synthetic graphs that mimic real-world networks for applications such as privacy-preserving data sharing, benchmarking, and simulation studies. We propose a novel approach leveraging graph neural networks (GNNs) and generative adversarial networks (GANs) to learn the structural and statistical characteristics of the target graph. Our method ensures that the generated graph maintains key properties, such as degree distribution, clustering coefficient, and community structure, while introducing controlled variations to ensure distinctness. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach outperforms existing graph generation techniques in terms of similarity metrics and computational efficiency. The generated doppelganger graphs are validated on real-world datasets, including social networks and citation networks, showcasing their utility in practical scenarios. This research contributes a robust framework for generating synthetic graphs that balance resemblance and uniqueness, with potential applications in anonymization, network analysis, and machine learning.  \n\n**Keywords**: Doppelganger graph, graph generation, graph neural networks, generative adversarial networks, synthetic networks, privacy-preserving data."}
{"text": "This paper introduces TallyQA, a novel framework designed to address the challenge of answering complex counting questions in visual and textual domains. The objective of this research is to bridge the gap in existing question-answering systems, which often struggle with counting tasks involving overlapping objects, occlusions, or abstract representations. To achieve this, we propose a hybrid approach combining advanced computer vision techniques with natural language processing (NLP) models. Our method leverages a multi-modal architecture that integrates object detection, scene understanding, and contextual reasoning to accurately interpret and count entities in both images and text.  \n\nExperiments conducted on a newly curated dataset, specifically designed for complex counting scenarios, demonstrate that TallyQA outperforms state-of-the-art baselines by a significant margin. The system achieves a 15% improvement in accuracy for counting tasks involving overlapping objects and a 20% enhancement in handling abstract counting questions. Furthermore, TallyQA exhibits robust generalization capabilities across diverse domains, including medical imaging, satellite imagery, and natural scenes.  \n\nThe implications of this research are far-reaching, with potential applications in fields such as autonomous systems, medical diagnostics, and environmental monitoring. By addressing the limitations of current counting models, TallyQA paves the way for more reliable and interpretable AI systems capable of handling real-world counting challenges.  \n\n**Keywords**: counting questions, multi-modal AI, object detection, natural language processing, visual question answering, complex reasoning."}

{"text": "This paper presents a novel approach for single-shot arbitrary-shaped text detection in natural scenes, leveraging a context-attended multi-task learning framework. The objective is to address the challenges of detecting text with diverse shapes, orientations, and scales, which are common in real-world applications such as document analysis and scene understanding. The proposed method integrates a context attention mechanism to enhance feature representation, enabling the model to focus on relevant text regions while suppressing background noise. A multi-task learning strategy is employed to simultaneously predict text regions, bounding boxes, and instance segmentation masks, ensuring robust detection of arbitrarily-shaped text. Experiments conducted on benchmark datasets, including ICDAR2015 and Total-Text, demonstrate that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming existing approaches in terms of accuracy and efficiency. The results highlight the effectiveness of the context attention mechanism and multi-task learning in improving text detection robustness. This research contributes to advancing text detection technologies, with potential applications in autonomous systems, augmented reality, and intelligent document processing.  \n\n**Keywords**: arbitrary-shaped text detection, context attention, multi-task learning, single-shot detection, scene text recognition, instance segmentation."}

{"text": "This paper addresses the challenge of interpreting feature representations in 3D point cloud data, a critical task for enhancing the transparency and trustworthiness of deep learning models in applications such as autonomous driving, robotics, and augmented reality. We propose a novel gradient-based explanation method tailored for 3D point clouds, leveraging the inherent spatial and structural properties of the data. Our approach extends traditional gradient-based techniques, such as saliency maps, to effectively highlight the most influential points and regions in the input data that contribute to the model's predictions. We evaluate the proposed method on widely used 3D point cloud datasets, comparing its performance against existing explanation techniques in terms of interpretability, computational efficiency, and alignment with human intuition. Results demonstrate that our method provides more precise and meaningful explanations, particularly in complex scenarios with occlusions and varying point densities. The findings underscore the potential of gradient-based methods to improve the interpretability of 3D deep learning models, paving the way for safer and more reliable deployment in real-world applications.

This paper introduces Asymmetric Generative Adversarial Networks (AGANs), a novel framework designed to address the limitations of existing symmetric architectures in image-to-image translation. The proposed approach leverages an asymmetric structure, where the generator and discriminator are optimized with distinct objectives, enhancing the model's ability to capture fine-grained details and improve translation quality. We evaluate AGANs on multiple benchmark datasets, including Cityscapes and CMP Facades, and demonstrate superior performance in terms of visual fidelity and structural consistency compared to state-of-the-art methods such as CycleGAN and Pix2Pix. Experimental results reveal that AGANs achieve a 15% improvement in Fr\u00e9chet Inception Distance (FID) scores and significantly reduce artifacts in generated images. The framework's flexibility allows for seamless integration into various applications, including medical imaging, artistic style transfer, and autonomous driving.

{"text": "This paper introduces *img2pose*, a novel framework for simultaneous face alignment and detection using 6 Degrees of Freedom (6DoF) face pose estimation. Traditional methods often treat face detection and alignment as separate tasks, leading to inefficiencies and suboptimal performance. *img2pose* addresses this limitation by directly estimating the 3D pose of a face in an image, enabling precise localization and alignment in a unified approach. The proposed method leverages a deep neural network architecture trained to predict the 6DoF pose parameters (translation and rotation) of a face relative to the camera. By incorporating 3D facial landmarks and pose information, *img2pose* achieves robust performance across varying head poses, lighting conditions, and occlusions. Experimental results demonstrate that the framework outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both face detection and alignment tasks, particularly in challenging scenarios such as extreme angles and partial occlusions. The approach also shows significant improvements in computational efficiency, making it suitable for real-time applications. The key contributions of this work include a unified framework for face detection and alignment, a novel 6DoF pose estimation model, and a robust solution for handling diverse real-world conditions. *img2pose* has potential applications in augmented reality, facial recognition, and human-computer interaction, where accurate and efficient face pose estimation is critical.  \n\n**Keywords**: Face detection, face alignment, 6DoF pose estimation, 3D facial landmarks, deep learning, real-time applications."}
{"text": "Training robust object detectors typically requires large-scale datasets with precise annotations, which are costly and time-consuming to obtain. This paper addresses the challenge of training object detectors using a limited number of weakly-labeled images and a large pool of unlabeled data. We propose a novel semi-supervised learning framework that leverages weak supervision from sparse annotations and exploits the abundance of unlabeled images to enhance model performance. Our approach integrates a self-training mechanism with a consistency regularization technique to effectively utilize unlabeled data while mitigating the noise introduced by weak labels. Experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that our method achieves competitive performance compared to fully-supervised baselines, even with significantly fewer labeled examples. The results highlight the potential of combining weak supervision and semi-supervised learning to reduce annotation costs while maintaining detection accuracy. This work contributes to advancing object detection in scenarios where labeled data is scarce, offering practical implications for real-world applications such as autonomous driving, medical imaging, and surveillance systems.  \n\n**Keywords**: object detection, weakly-supervised learning, semi-supervised learning, self-training, consistency regularization, unlabeled data."}

{"text": "Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have revolutionized the field of generative modeling, yet their training dynamics remain challenging due to instability and convergence issues. This paper investigates the local stability of gradient descent optimization in GANs, providing a theoretical foundation for understanding their training behavior. We analyze the optimization landscape of GANs under gradient descent, focusing on the interaction between the generator and discriminator networks. By leveraging tools from dynamical systems theory, we demonstrate that gradient descent optimization exhibits local stability under specific conditions, particularly when the generator and discriminator are near equilibrium. Our findings reveal that the stability of GAN training is highly dependent on the initialization of model parameters and the learning rate. Furthermore, we identify key factors that influence convergence, including the balance between the generator and discriminator updates and the curvature of the loss landscape. These insights contribute to a deeper understanding of GAN training dynamics and offer practical implications for improving optimization strategies. The results highlight the importance of careful parameter tuning and initialization in achieving stable GAN training, paving the way for more robust and efficient generative models.  \n\n**Keywords**: Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), gradient descent, optimization stability, dynamical systems, convergence analysis, generative modeling."}

The dataset is designed to reflect realistic urban scenarios, including varying weather conditions, lighting, and occlusion levels, making it a robust resource for training and evaluating object detection models.  \n\nTo demonstrate the utility of the ECP dataset, we evaluate state-of-the-art object detection algorithms, including Faster R-CNN, YOLOv5, and DETR, across multiple performance metrics such as precision, recall, and mean average precision (mAP).

This paper addresses the problem of improving temporal credit assignment in episodic RL by leveraging sequence modeling techniques.

Our method employs a combination of self-attention mechanisms and reward propagation strategies to dynamically adjust credit assignment during training. Experimental results on benchmark episodic RL tasks demonstrate significant improvements in learning efficiency and policy performance compared to traditional methods, such as Monte Carlo and temporal difference approaches. The proposed model achieves higher cumulative rewards and faster convergence, particularly in environments with sparse and delayed rewards. This work highlights the potential of sequence modeling in addressing temporal credit assignment challenges, offering a scalable and effective solution for episodic RL applications.

This paper introduces Parametrized Deep Q-Networks (PDQN), a novel framework designed to address the limitations of existing RL methods in handling discrete-continuous hybrid action spaces. The proposed approach leverages a parametrized Q-network architecture that decouples the selection of discrete actions from the optimization of continuous parameters, enabling efficient exploration and learning in complex environments. We evaluate PDQN on a suite of benchmark tasks, including robotic control and autonomous navigation, demonstrating its superior performance compared to state-of-the-art hybrid RL methods.

The objective is to understand how hierarchical structures, such as object relationships and spatial arrangements, are implicitly learned by generative models during the synthesis of complex scenes. We propose a novel framework that leverages a deep generative model, specifically a hierarchical variational autoencoder (VAE), to capture and analyze the latent representations of scenes. The model is trained on a diverse dataset of annotated scenes, enabling it to learn both low-level features (e.g., textures, shapes) and high-level semantic relationships (e.g., object interactions, scene composition). Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that the model successfully encodes a semantic hierarchy in its latent space, allowing for controlled scene generation and manipulation. Quantitative evaluations show significant improvements in scene coherence and realism compared to existing methods. Furthermore, qualitative analysis reveals that the model can disentangle and interpret hierarchical structures, enabling applications such as scene editing and conditional synthesis. The findings highlight the potential of deep generative models to not only synthesize visually plausible scenes but also to implicitly learn and utilize semantic hierarchies, offering new insights for applications in computer vision, virtual reality, and autonomous systems.  \n\n**Keywords**: scene synthesis, deep generative models, semantic hierarchy, variational autoencoder, latent representations, computer vision."}
{"text": "Disentangled text representation learning aims to separate latent factors of variation in textual data, enabling more interpretable and controllable representations. However, achieving effective disentanglement remains challenging due to the inherent complexity of natural language. This paper proposes a novel framework for improving disentangled text representation learning by incorporating information-theoretic guidance. Our approach leverages mutual information minimization and maximization principles to encourage the separation of latent factors while preserving task-relevant information. We introduce a variational autoencoder-based model enhanced with an information-theoretic regularization term, which explicitly controls the trade-off between disentanglement and reconstruction fidelity. Experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms existing approaches in terms of both disentanglement metrics and downstream task performance. The results highlight the effectiveness of information-theoretic guidance in learning more interpretable and robust text representations. This work contributes to advancing the field of representation learning by providing a principled and scalable solution for disentangling textual data, with potential applications in natural language understanding, controllable text generation, and domain adaptation.  \n\n**Keywords**: disentangled representation learning, information theory, variational autoencoder, natural language processing, mutual information, text representation."}
{"text": "The Attention Branch Network (ABN) introduces a novel framework for enhancing visual explanation in deep learning models by integrating an attention mechanism into the learning process. The primary objective of this research is to improve model interpretability while maintaining high accuracy in visual recognition tasks. Traditional convolutional neural networks (CNNs) often lack transparency in decision-making, making it challenging to understand which regions of an image contribute most to the model's predictions. To address this, ABN incorporates a two-branch architecture: a perception branch for feature extraction and classification, and an attention branch that generates attention maps to highlight salient regions in the input image. These attention maps are used to guide the model's focus during training, enabling it to learn more interpretable and robust representations. Experiments conducted on benchmark datasets, such as CIFAR-10 and ImageNet, demonstrate that ABN achieves competitive accuracy while providing clear visual explanations of its predictions. The results show that the proposed method outperforms existing attention-based models in terms of both performance and interpretability. This work contributes to the growing field of explainable AI by offering a scalable and effective approach for integrating attention mechanisms into deep learning architectures. The implications of this research extend to applications requiring transparent decision-making, such as medical imaging, autonomous driving, and surveillance systems.

The objective of this research is to address the challenges of generating high-quality 3D meshes from sparse or unstructured point clouds, a critical task in applications such as 3D reconstruction, computer vision, and augmented reality. Traditional methods often struggle with preserving geometric details and maintaining computational efficiency. To overcome these limitations, *GAMesh* integrates a deep learning-based approach with a guided meshing pipeline, leveraging both geometric priors and learned features to enhance mesh generation. The proposed method employs a hybrid architecture that combines point cloud feature extraction with a differentiable mesh refinement module, enabling end-to-end training and optimization. Experimental results demonstrate that *GAMesh* outperforms existing techniques in terms of mesh accuracy, detail preservation, and computational efficiency, achieving state-of-the-art performance on benchmark datasets. The framework\u2019s ability to handle noisy and incomplete point clouds further highlights its robustness. The implications of this work extend to various domains, including autonomous systems, medical imaging, and virtual reality, where accurate and efficient 3D mesh generation is essential. *GAMesh* represents a significant advancement in deep point network-based meshing, offering a scalable and adaptable solution for real-world applications.  \n\n**Keywords**: 3D meshing, point clouds, deep learning, 3D reconstruction, geometric priors, differentiable refinement."}

{"text": "This paper introduces LSALSA (Learned Sparse Coding for Accelerated Source Separation), a novel framework designed to enhance the efficiency and accuracy of source separation tasks. Traditional sparse coding methods often struggle with computational complexity and scalability, particularly in large-scale applications. To address these challenges, LSALSA leverages a learned sparse coding approach, integrating deep learning techniques to optimize the sparse representation of signals. The proposed method employs a hybrid architecture that combines unsupervised sparse coding with supervised learning, enabling the model to adaptively learn sparse dictionaries tailored to specific datasets.  \n\nExperiments conducted on benchmark datasets demonstrate that LSALSA significantly outperforms conventional sparse coding methods in terms of both separation quality and computational speed. The framework achieves a 30% reduction in processing time while maintaining superior signal-to-noise ratios (SNR) compared to state-of-the-art techniques. Furthermore, LSALSA exhibits robust generalization capabilities across diverse domains, including audio, image, and biomedical signal separation.  \n\nThe key contribution of this work lies in its ability to bridge the gap between traditional sparse coding and modern machine learning, offering a scalable and efficient solution for real-world source separation problems. The implications of LSALSA extend to applications such as speech enhancement, medical imaging, and multimedia processing, where accurate and rapid source separation is critical.  \n\n**Keywords**: source separation, sparse coding, deep learning, signal processing, LSALSA, computational efficiency."}

{"text": "The increasing demand for efficient neural network inference on resource-constrained devices has driven the need for optimized convolution operations. This paper introduces **LANCE**, a novel framework for **low-precision quantized Winograd convolution** tailored for **Graphics Processing Units (GPUs)**. The primary objective of LANCE is to reduce computational overhead and memory usage while maintaining high accuracy in neural network inference. To achieve this, we propose a **quantization-aware Winograd algorithm** that leverages **8-bit integer arithmetic** and **GPU-specific optimizations**, such as warp-level parallelism and memory coalescing. Our approach significantly reduces the precision requirements of convolution operations without compromising performance. Experimental results demonstrate that LANCE achieves up to **2.5x speedup** and **40% reduction in memory consumption** compared to traditional floating-point Winograd convolution, while maintaining competitive accuracy on benchmark datasets such as CIFAR-10 and ImageNet. The framework also outperforms existing low-precision convolution methods in terms of both computational efficiency and scalability. The key contribution of this work lies in its **novel integration of quantization techniques with Winograd convolution**, enabling efficient deployment of deep learning models on edge devices and GPUs. LANCE provides a practical solution for accelerating neural network inference in real-world applications, such as autonomous systems and mobile computing, where computational resources are limited.  \n\n**Keywords**: Low-precision quantization, Winograd convolution, GPU optimization, neural networks, efficient inference, deep learning acceleration."}
{"text": "Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) has emerged as a prominent reinforcement learning algorithm due to its stability and performance across diverse tasks. However, its exploration efficiency remains a critical challenge, often leading to suboptimal policy convergence. This paper addresses this limitation by proposing an enhanced exploration mechanism integrated into the PPO framework. Our approach introduces a novel exploration strategy that dynamically adjusts the exploration-exploitation trade-off based on the policy's learning progress, ensuring more efficient sampling of the environment. We evaluate the proposed method on a suite of benchmark environments, including continuous control and high-dimensional state spaces. Experimental results demonstrate significant improvements in sample efficiency and final policy performance compared to standard PPO and other state-of-the-art methods. The enhanced PPO achieves up to a 25% reduction in training time while maintaining or surpassing baseline performance metrics. This work contributes to the advancement of reinforcement learning by providing a practical and scalable solution to improve exploration efficiency in policy optimization. The proposed method has potential applications in robotics, autonomous systems, and other domains requiring efficient and robust decision-making.  \n\n**Keywords**: Proximal Policy Optimization, reinforcement learning, exploration efficiency, policy convergence, sample efficiency, autonomous systems."}
{"text": "Attributed network clustering, which aims to group nodes based on both network structure and node attributes, is a fundamental problem in network analysis. Traditional methods often struggle to effectively integrate these two types of information, leading to suboptimal clustering performance. This paper introduces a novel approach, Variational Co-embedding Learning (VCL), which jointly learns latent representations for both network structure and node attributes in a unified framework. VCL leverages variational inference to model the probabilistic relationships between nodes and their attributes, enabling the capture of complex dependencies and improving clustering accuracy. The proposed method employs a co-embedding mechanism that ensures the learned representations are mutually informative and aligned, facilitating better integration of structural and attribute information. Experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that VCL outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of clustering quality and robustness. The results highlight the effectiveness of the variational co-embedding approach in capturing the intrinsic relationships within attributed networks. This work contributes to the field by providing a scalable and interpretable solution for attributed network clustering, with potential applications in social network analysis, recommendation systems, and bioinformatics.  \n\n**Keywords**: attributed network clustering, variational inference, co-embedding, representation learning, network analysis."}
