{"text": "The rapid advancement of conversational AI has led to significant interest in developing models that can engage in natural, human-like dialogue. This paper introduces a novel Face-to-Face Neural Conversation Model (F2F-NCM) designed to enhance the quality and realism of conversational interactions. The primary objective of this research is to address the limitations of existing dialogue systems, such as lack of contextual understanding and emotional resonance, by leveraging advanced neural architectures. Our approach integrates a transformer-based framework with multimodal inputs, including facial expressions and voice tone, to enable more context-aware and emotionally intelligent responses. The model is trained on a diverse dataset of real-world conversations, ensuring robustness across various interaction scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate that F2F-NCM outperforms state-of-the-art models in terms of dialogue coherence, user engagement, and emotional alignment. Key findings reveal a 15% improvement in user satisfaction scores compared to baseline models. The implications of this research extend to applications in virtual assistants, customer service, and mental health support, where human-like interaction is critical. This work contributes to the field by introducing a multimodal, context-sensitive approach to conversational AI, paving the way for more natural and empathetic human-machine interactions.  \n\n**Keywords**: conversational AI, neural networks, multimodal learning, transformer models, emotional intelligence, human-computer interaction."}

{"text": "Object detection is a critical task in computer vision, with applications ranging from autonomous driving to surveillance systems. This paper introduces YOLOv4, a state-of-the-art object detection framework designed to achieve optimal balance between speed and accuracy. Building upon the success of its predecessors, YOLOv4 incorporates advanced techniques such as Cross-Stage Partial connections (CSP), Mish activation, and a modified spatial pyramid pooling (SPP) module to enhance feature extraction and model efficiency. Additionally, the framework leverages Bag of Freebies (BoF) and Bag of Specials (BoS) strategies to improve training stability and detection performance without significantly increasing computational cost.  \n\nExperimental results demonstrate that YOLOv4 outperforms existing object detection models in terms of both inference speed and accuracy on benchmark datasets such as COCO and PASCAL VOC. Specifically, YOLOv4 achieves a 10% improvement in average precision (AP) while maintaining real-time processing capabilities. The model's efficiency makes it suitable for deployment on resource-constrained devices, further broadening its applicability.  \n\nThe contributions of this work include a comprehensive analysis of modern object detection techniques, the integration of novel architectural improvements, and the establishment of a new benchmark for real-time object detection. YOLOv4 represents a significant advancement in the field, offering a robust solution for applications requiring high-speed and high-accuracy detection.  \n\n**Keywords**: YOLOv4, object detection, real-time processing, computer vision, deep learning, CSP, Mish activation, SPP."}
{"text": "Visual recognition systems often struggle to accurately interpret complex scenes due to the lack of contextual understanding and attention to relevant details. This paper introduces a novel approach, Plan-Recognition-Driven Attention Modeling (PRAM), which integrates plan recognition techniques with attention mechanisms to enhance visual recognition performance. The proposed method leverages hierarchical plan structures to guide attention models, enabling the system to focus on semantically meaningful regions in an image or video. By aligning attention with inferred plans, PRAM improves the interpretability and accuracy of visual recognition tasks. We evaluate the approach on benchmark datasets for action recognition and scene understanding, demonstrating significant improvements over state-of-the-art methods. Experimental results show that PRAM achieves higher precision in recognizing complex activities and scenes, particularly in scenarios with occlusions or ambiguous visual cues. The findings highlight the potential of combining plan recognition with attention modeling to advance visual recognition systems, offering applications in autonomous systems, surveillance, and human-computer interaction. This research contributes a new perspective on integrating high-level reasoning with low-level visual processing, paving the way for more context-aware and robust recognition frameworks.  \n\n**Keywords**: visual recognition, attention modeling, plan recognition, scene understanding, action recognition, context-aware systems."}

{"text": "Domain adaptation is a critical challenge in machine learning, particularly when models trained on one dataset fail to generalize to another due to domain shifts. This paper introduces *Generate to Adapt (GTA)*, a novel framework leveraging Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to align source and target domains effectively. The proposed approach employs a domain-adversarial training mechanism, where a generator synthesizes target-like data from the source domain, while a discriminator distinguishes between real and generated samples. Simultaneously, a feature extractor and classifier are optimized to ensure domain-invariant representations and accurate predictions. Experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that GTA outperforms existing domain adaptation methods, achieving significant improvements in classification accuracy across diverse tasks. The framework\u2019s ability to generate realistic domain-aligned data and its robustness to domain shifts highlight its potential for real-world applications, such as cross-domain image recognition and autonomous systems. This work contributes to advancing domain adaptation by integrating generative modeling with adversarial learning, offering a scalable and effective solution for bridging domain gaps.  \n\n**Keywords**: Domain Adaptation, Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), Adversarial Learning, Cross-Domain Generalization, Machine Learning."}
{"text": "Graphical models are widely used for probabilistic inference in various domains, but solving inference problems efficiently remains a challenge due to their computational complexity. This paper explores the potential of leveraging reinforcement learning (RL) to automatically learn heuristics for graphical model inference. The objective is to develop a framework that can adaptively generate efficient inference strategies without relying on handcrafted rules or domain-specific knowledge. We propose a novel RL-based approach where an agent interacts with the graphical model environment to learn policies that optimize inference performance. The agent is trained using a combination of policy gradient methods and reward shaping techniques tailored to the inference task. Experimental results demonstrate that the learned heuristics outperform traditional methods in terms of inference accuracy and computational efficiency across multiple benchmark datasets. Furthermore, the approach exhibits strong generalization capabilities, adapting to different types of graphical models and problem sizes. This work highlights the potential of RL as a powerful tool for automating the design of inference algorithms, offering a scalable and flexible alternative to conventional techniques. The findings have implications for applications in machine learning, computer vision, and probabilistic reasoning, where efficient inference is critical.  \n\n**Keywords**: graphical models, reinforcement learning, probabilistic inference, heuristics, policy optimization, computational efficiency."}
{"text": "Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) have emerged as a powerful framework for learning representations of graph-structured data, with applications ranging from social network analysis to molecular property prediction. Despite their success, many existing GCN architectures rely on complex designs that may hinder interpretability and scalability. This paper introduces **Simple and Deep Graph Convolutional Networks (SD-GCN)**, a novel approach that emphasizes simplicity while achieving competitive performance. The proposed method leverages a straightforward yet effective architecture, combining shallow layers with residual connections to enable deeper models without suffering from over-smoothing or vanishing gradients. We evaluate SD-GCN on multiple benchmark datasets, demonstrating its ability to outperform state-of-the-art methods in node classification and graph classification tasks. Our results highlight the importance of architectural simplicity in GCN design, offering insights into the trade-offs between model complexity and performance. The proposed framework not only advances the field of graph representation learning but also provides a foundation for future research into efficient and interpretable graph neural networks. Key contributions include a scalable and interpretable architecture, improved performance on standard benchmarks, and a deeper understanding of the role of simplicity in GCN design.  \n\n**Keywords**: Graph Convolutional Networks, Graph Neural Networks, Deep Learning, Node Classification, Graph Classification, Residual Connections."}
{"text": "Phase contrast microscopy is a widely used technique for observing live cells without staining, but automated segmentation of cell populations in such images remains a challenging task due to noise, low contrast, and overlapping cells. This paper provides a comprehensive survey of existing methods for cell population segmentation in phase contrast microscopy images, focusing on their strengths, limitations, and applicability across diverse biological contexts. We categorize the approaches into traditional image processing techniques, machine learning-based methods, and deep learning architectures, highlighting their underlying principles and performance metrics. Key findings reveal that deep learning models, particularly convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and U-Net variants, have achieved state-of-the-art results by leveraging large annotated datasets and advanced feature extraction capabilities. However, challenges such as dataset scarcity, generalization across cell types, and computational complexity persist. The survey concludes with a discussion of emerging trends, including self-supervised learning and hybrid models, which hold promise for improving segmentation accuracy and robustness. This work serves as a valuable resource for researchers aiming to develop or adapt segmentation methods for phase contrast microscopy, with potential applications in cell biology, drug discovery, and medical diagnostics.  \n\n**Keywords**: Phase contrast microscopy, cell segmentation, deep learning, convolutional neural networks, image processing, U-Net, machine learning."}

{"text": "This paper addresses the challenge of moment localization in videos using natural language queries, a critical task in video understanding and retrieval. We propose a novel 2D Temporal Adjacent Network (2D-TAN) framework that effectively captures temporal dependencies and aligns video segments with textual descriptions. Unlike existing methods that rely on one-dimensional temporal modeling, our approach leverages a 2D feature map to represent temporal relationships between video moments, enabling more precise localization. The proposed model integrates a cross-modal attention mechanism to enhance the alignment between visual and textual features, improving the accuracy of moment retrieval. Experiments conducted on benchmark datasets demonstrate that 2D-TAN outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of recall and precision metrics. The results highlight the effectiveness of our approach in handling complex temporal structures and diverse query descriptions. This work contributes to advancing video understanding by introducing a robust and scalable solution for moment localization, with potential applications in video search, summarization, and content recommendation systems.  \n\n**Keywords**: moment localization, video understanding, natural language queries, 2D temporal modeling, cross-modal attention, video retrieval."}
{"text": "This paper introduces *Deep Fluids*, a novel generative network designed to parameterize and accelerate fluid simulations. The objective of this research is to address the computational inefficiencies of traditional fluid simulation methods, which often require significant computational resources and time. To achieve this, we propose a deep learning-based framework that leverages a generative adversarial network (GAN) architecture to model complex fluid dynamics. The network is trained on a diverse dataset of fluid behaviors, enabling it to generate high-fidelity fluid simulations with reduced computational overhead. Our approach incorporates a physics-informed loss function to ensure the generated results adhere to fundamental fluid dynamics principles. Experimental results demonstrate that *Deep Fluids* achieves a 40% reduction in simulation time compared to state-of-the-art methods while maintaining comparable accuracy. Furthermore, the model exhibits strong generalization capabilities across various fluid scenarios, including turbulent flows and surface interactions. The implications of this work extend to real-time applications in gaming, visual effects, and scientific visualization, where efficient and realistic fluid simulations are critical. This research contributes a scalable and innovative solution to the challenges of fluid simulation, paving the way for broader adoption of AI-driven techniques in computational physics.  \n\n**Keywords**: fluid simulation, generative adversarial networks, deep learning, physics-informed models, computational efficiency, real-time rendering."}

The objective of this research is to bridge the gap between high-level semantic representations and detailed 3D scene generation, enabling intuitive and efficient creation of complex 3D environments. Leveraging a graph-based approach, the proposed method translates scene graphs\u2014comprising objects, attributes, and relationships\u2014into fully realized 3D scenes. The framework employs a combination of graph neural networks (GNNs) and generative adversarial networks (GANs) to model object placements, spatial relationships, and scene aesthetics. Experimental results demonstrate that *Graph-to-3D* outperforms existing methods in terms of scene fidelity, semantic consistency, and user control, achieving a 15% improvement in scene reconstruction accuracy and a 20% reduction in computational overhead. The system also supports real-time scene manipulation, allowing users to dynamically modify object attributes or relationships while preserving scene coherence. This work contributes to the fields of 3D reconstruction and scene generation by providing a scalable, user-friendly solution for applications in virtual reality, gaming, and architectural design.

{"text": "The reliability of classifiers in decision-making systems is critical, yet determining when to trust their predictions remains a significant challenge. This paper addresses the problem of quantifying and evaluating the trustworthiness of classifiers in real-world applications. We propose a novel framework that assesses classifier confidence by analyzing prediction uncertainty and model behavior under varying conditions. Our approach leverages probabilistic modeling and uncertainty estimation techniques to identify scenarios where classifier outputs may be unreliable. Through extensive experiments on benchmark datasets, we demonstrate that our method effectively distinguishes between accurate and erroneous predictions, outperforming traditional confidence-based metrics. The results highlight the importance of incorporating uncertainty awareness into trust evaluation, particularly in high-stakes domains such as healthcare and autonomous systems. This research contributes a practical tool for improving decision-making reliability and provides insights into the limitations of current classifier trust mechanisms. The proposed framework has broad implications for enhancing the robustness and transparency of machine learning systems in critical applications.  \n\n**Keywords**: classifier trust, uncertainty estimation, probabilistic modeling, decision-making, machine learning reliability."}
{"text": "Vision Transformers (ViTs) have emerged as a powerful alternative to convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for image recognition tasks, leveraging self-attention mechanisms to capture long-range dependencies. However, existing ViTs often struggle with balancing computational efficiency and the ability to model both local and global visual patterns effectively. This paper introduces a novel Local-to-Global Self-Attention (LGSA) mechanism designed to address this challenge. LGSA hierarchically processes visual information by first focusing on local regions within an image and then progressively expanding to global contexts, enabling efficient and comprehensive feature extraction. We propose a lightweight yet effective architecture that integrates LGSA into the transformer framework, reducing computational overhead while maintaining high accuracy. Experiments on benchmark datasets, including ImageNet and COCO, demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art ViTs in terms of both performance and efficiency. The results highlight the potential of LGSA to enhance vision transformers for a wide range of applications, including object detection and image classification.

Traditional WoE methods are widely used in credit scoring and risk assessment but often suffer from overfitting and suboptimal binning strategies. The proposed approach addresses these limitations by incorporating regularization through shrinkage, ensuring more stable and generalizable models, and leveraging spline-binning to dynamically optimize variable discretization. The methodology is evaluated on benchmark datasets, demonstrating significant improvements in predictive accuracy and model stability compared to conventional WoE methods. Results indicate that WoE 2.0 achieves superior performance in handling noisy and imbalanced data, making it particularly suitable for applications in finance, healthcare, and other domains requiring reliable risk assessment. The framework\u2019s flexibility and interpretability also facilitate easier integration into existing workflows.

{"text": "This paper explores the application of Neural Fictitious Self-Play (NFSP) to the ELF Mini-RTS environment, a simplified real-time strategy (RTS) game designed for reinforcement learning research. The objective is to investigate the effectiveness of NFSP, a deep reinforcement learning algorithm, in mastering complex decision-making tasks in dynamic, multi-agent environments. We propose a modified NFSP framework tailored to the unique challenges of RTS games, such as partial observability, high-dimensional action spaces, and long-term strategic planning. Our approach integrates deep neural networks with fictitious self-play to enable agents to learn both optimal strategies and adaptive behaviors through self-play. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves competitive performance against baseline algorithms, including traditional reinforcement learning and rule-based agents, in terms of win rates and strategic adaptability. Furthermore, the study highlights the potential of NFSP in scaling to more complex RTS environments and its ability to generalize across diverse game scenarios. The findings contribute to advancing multi-agent reinforcement learning techniques for real-world applications, such as autonomous systems and strategic planning, while providing insights into the challenges of training agents in dynamic, adversarial environments.  \n\n**Keywords**: Neural Fictitious Self-Play, ELF Mini-RTS, reinforcement learning, multi-agent systems, real-time strategy games, deep learning."}
{"text": "This paper addresses the challenge of unsupervised shape completion, a critical task in 3D reconstruction and computer vision, where the goal is to infer complete 3D shapes from partial or incomplete input data. Traditional methods often rely on supervised learning, requiring extensive labeled datasets, which are costly and time-consuming to obtain. To overcome this limitation, we propose a novel unsupervised approach leveraging deep prior in the Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK) perspective. Our method utilizes the inherent properties of neural networks to regularize the shape completion process without the need for labeled data. By analyzing the NTK framework, we demonstrate how the implicit regularization of deep networks can be harnessed to achieve high-quality shape completion. Experimental results on benchmark datasets show that our approach outperforms existing unsupervised methods and achieves competitive performance compared to supervised techniques. The proposed method not only reduces dependency on labeled data but also provides a robust and scalable solution for real-world applications in robotics, augmented reality, and autonomous systems. Key contributions include a theoretical analysis of deep prior in the NTK context and a practical framework for unsupervised shape completion.

{"text": "Scene text recognition (STR) is a critical task in computer vision with applications ranging from document analysis to autonomous systems. Despite significant progress, accurately recognizing text in complex scenes remains challenging due to variations in font, orientation, and background clutter. This paper introduces a novel Semantic Reasoning Network (SRN) designed to enhance STR by integrating semantic context into the recognition process. The proposed approach leverages a multi-stage architecture that combines convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for feature extraction with a transformer-based reasoning module to capture long-range dependencies and contextual relationships within the text. Experiments conducted on benchmark datasets, including ICDAR2015 and COCO-Text, demonstrate that SRN achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming existing methods in terms of accuracy and robustness. The results highlight the effectiveness of semantic reasoning in improving text recognition, particularly in challenging scenarios.

{"text": "This paper addresses the challenge of achieving controllable invariance in machine learning models, a critical requirement for ensuring robustness and fairness in real-world applications. We propose a novel framework based on adversarial feature learning, which enables the explicit control of invariant representations while maintaining model performance. Our approach leverages adversarial training to disentangle sensitive attributes from the learned features, ensuring that the model remains invariant to unwanted variations such as biases or domain shifts. We introduce a flexible optimization strategy that allows users to specify the degree of invariance, balancing it with task-specific accuracy. Experiments conducted on benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in achieving superior invariance control compared to existing techniques. The results highlight significant improvements in fairness metrics and robustness to adversarial perturbations. This work contributes a scalable and adaptable solution for applications requiring controlled invariance, such as bias mitigation in AI systems and domain adaptation in transfer learning.

While deep learning-based methods have achieved remarkable performance, they often rely on large and computationally expensive models, limiting their practical deployment. This paper introduces a novel approach, *Contrastive Self-distillation*, to achieve compact and efficient SISR models without sacrificing performance. Our method leverages self-distillation to transfer knowledge from a larger teacher model to a lightweight student model, enhanced by a contrastive learning framework that improves feature representation and generalization. Experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves competitive results compared to state-of-the-art methods while significantly reducing model size and computational overhead. The compactness and efficiency of our model make it suitable for real-world applications, particularly in resource-constrained environments. This work contributes to advancing efficient SISR by combining self-distillation and contrastive learning, offering a promising direction for future research in lightweight image restoration.  \n\n**Keywords**: Single image super-resolution, self-distillation, contrastive learning, lightweight models, deep learning, computer vision."}

{"text": "Feature importance estimation is a critical task in machine learning, particularly for understanding model behavior and ensuring interpretability. However, existing methods often struggle to maintain accuracy and robustness when the data distribution shifts, limiting their reliability in real-world applications. This paper addresses this challenge by proposing a novel framework for accurate and robust feature importance estimation under distribution shifts. Our approach leverages a combination of distributionally robust optimization (DRO) and adaptive feature weighting to ensure consistent performance across varying data environments. We introduce a new algorithm that dynamically adjusts feature importance scores based on the underlying data distribution, minimizing the impact of distributional changes. Experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms traditional approaches, achieving higher accuracy and stability under both covariate and concept shifts. The results highlight the framework's ability to provide reliable feature importance estimates, even in non-stationary environments. This work contributes to advancing interpretable machine learning by offering a robust solution for feature importance estimation, with potential applications in domains such as healthcare, finance, and autonomous systems.  \n\n**Keywords**: feature importance, distribution shifts, robust optimization, interpretability, machine learning, adaptive weighting."}

{"text": "Face anti-spoofing is a critical challenge in biometric security, aimed at distinguishing genuine human faces from spoofing attacks such as printed photos, videos, or 3D masks. Traditional methods often struggle with generalization across diverse attack types and environmental conditions. This paper introduces a novel Physics-Guided Spoof Trace Disentanglement (PGSTD) framework for generic face anti-spoofing. The proposed approach leverages physical properties of spoofing traces, such as reflection, texture, and depth anomalies, to disentangle spoof-specific features from genuine facial characteristics. A multi-branch neural network architecture is employed, integrating physics-based constraints to guide the learning process and enhance interpretability. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets, including CASIA-SURF, Replay-Attack, and OULU-NPU, demonstrate that PGSTD achieves state-of-the-art performance, with significant improvements in cross-dataset generalization.

{"text": "Domain adaptation (DA) has emerged as a critical challenge in computer vision, particularly when models trained on one dataset (source domain) fail to generalize effectively to another (target domain) due to distribution shifts. This paper presents a comprehensive survey of deep visual domain adaptation techniques, focusing on recent advancements and methodologies designed to bridge the gap between source and target domains. We categorize existing approaches into feature-based, adversarial, and self-supervised learning methods, highlighting their underlying principles and architectures. Key findings reveal that adversarial training and feature alignment strategies have significantly improved cross-domain performance, while self-supervised techniques offer promising avenues for reducing reliance on labeled target data. Our analysis also identifies limitations in current methods, such as scalability and robustness to extreme domain shifts. The survey concludes with insights into future research directions, emphasizing the need for more efficient, generalizable, and interpretable domain adaptation frameworks. This work serves as a valuable resource for researchers and practitioners aiming to advance the state-of-the-art in deep visual domain adaptation.  \n\n**Keywords**: domain adaptation, deep learning, computer vision, adversarial learning, feature alignment, self-supervised learning."}

{"text": "Reinforcement learning (RL) with once-per-episode feedback presents a unique challenge in optimizing agent performance under limited information. This paper investigates the theoretical foundations of RL in scenarios where feedback is provided only once per episode, rather than at each time step. We propose a novel framework that leverages episodic feedback to guide policy optimization, addressing the inherent trade-off between exploration and exploitation in such settings. Our approach combines model-free RL techniques with episodic reward decomposition, enabling efficient learning despite sparse feedback. Theoretical analysis demonstrates the convergence properties of our method, and empirical evaluations on benchmark environments show significant improvements in sample efficiency and final performance compared to traditional RL algorithms. The results highlight the potential of episodic feedback in reducing computational overhead while maintaining competitive learning outcomes. This work contributes to the broader understanding of RL under limited feedback regimes, offering insights for applications in real-world systems where frequent feedback is impractical.  \n\n**Keywords**: reinforcement learning, episodic feedback, policy optimization, sample efficiency, exploration-exploitation trade-off."}

This paper addresses the problem of domain generalization in FAS by proposing a novel approach that leverages pseudo-domain labels to enhance model robustness. Our method introduces a pseudo-domain labeling mechanism that automatically categorizes unseen domains during training, enabling the model to learn domain-invariant features effectively. We employ a multi-task learning framework that combines domain classification and spoofing detection, optimizing the model to distinguish between genuine and spoofed faces while adapting to domain shifts. Experimental results on benchmark datasets, including CASIA-SURF and OULU-NPU, demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming existing methods in cross-domain scenarios. The proposed framework not only improves generalization but also reduces the dependency on labeled domain-specific data, making it highly practical for real-world applications. This work contributes to advancing FAS technology by providing a scalable and domain-agnostic solution, with potential implications for enhancing biometric security systems.  \n\n**Keywords**: Face anti-spoofing, domain generalization, pseudo-domain labels, multi-task learning, biometric security."}

{"text": "This paper presents a novel approach for the automatic localization of deep brain stimulation (DBS) electrodes using a trajectory-based segmentation method. The accurate localization of DBS electrodes is critical for optimizing therapeutic outcomes in neurological disorders, yet manual methods are time-consuming and prone to human error. To address this challenge, we propose a computational framework that leverages trajectory-based segmentation to precisely identify electrode positions from post-operative imaging data. Our approach integrates advanced image processing techniques with machine learning algorithms to automate the detection and localization process. The method was evaluated on a dataset of post-operative MRI and CT scans, demonstrating high accuracy and robustness compared to existing techniques. Results indicate significant improvements in localization precision, with an average error reduction of 30% over traditional methods. The proposed system not only enhances efficiency but also provides a reliable tool for clinicians to optimize DBS therapy planning. This research contributes to the growing field of medical imaging and computational neuroscience by offering a scalable and automated solution for electrode localization, with potential applications in personalized medicine and treatment optimization.  \n\n**Keywords**: Deep brain stimulation, electrode localization, trajectory-based segmentation, medical imaging, machine learning, computational neuroscience."}
{"text": "This paper addresses the challenge of relative camera pose estimation, a critical task in computer vision with applications in augmented reality, robotics, and 3D reconstruction. Traditional methods often rely on handcrafted features and geometric constraints, which can struggle with robustness in complex or dynamic environments. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel approach leveraging Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to directly estimate the relative pose between two camera views. Our method processes pairs of images through a deep learning architecture designed to learn spatial and geometric relationships, eliminating the need for explicit feature extraction and matching. The network is trained on a large-scale dataset of synthetic and real-world image pairs, enabling it to generalize across diverse scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate that our CNN-based approach achieves state-of-the-art performance in terms of accuracy and robustness, outperforming traditional methods in challenging conditions such as low texture and occlusions. The proposed framework also exhibits significant computational efficiency, making it suitable for real-time applications. This work contributes to the advancement of camera pose estimation by introducing a data-driven, end-to-end solution that reduces reliance on manual feature engineering and enhances adaptability to real-world complexities.

This paper addresses the limitations of existing fire detection systems, which often struggle with accuracy, latency, and adaptability in dynamic environments. We propose a novel approach leveraging advanced computer vision techniques and deep learning models to achieve robust and efficient fire detection in real-time. Our method integrates a lightweight convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture optimized for edge devices, enabling rapid processing of video streams with minimal computational overhead. Additionally, we introduce a multi-spectral analysis framework that enhances detection accuracy by combining visible and infrared data. Experimental results demonstrate that our system achieves a detection accuracy of 98.5% with a latency of less than 50 milliseconds, outperforming state-of-the-art methods. The proposed solution is scalable and adaptable to various environments, including industrial settings, urban areas, and forests. This research contributes to the development of reliable, real-time fire detection systems, offering significant potential for improving disaster response and prevention strategies.  \n\n**Keywords**: fire detection, real-time systems, computer vision, deep learning, convolutional neural networks, multi-spectral analysis."}

{"text": "Transformer-XL addresses a critical limitation in traditional transformer-based language models: the inability to handle dependencies beyond a fixed-length context. While transformers have revolutionized natural language processing (NLP), their fixed context windows restrict their ability to model long-range dependencies, which are essential for tasks like document-level understanding and coherent text generation. To overcome this, Transformer-XL introduces a novel architecture that enables learning dependencies beyond a predefined context length through two key innovations: segment-level recurrence and relative positional encoding. The segment-level recurrence mechanism allows the model to reuse hidden states from previous segments, effectively creating a memory that extends the context window. Relative positional encoding, on the other hand, ensures that positional information is preserved across segments, enabling the model to generalize better to sequences of varying lengths.  \n\nExperiments demonstrate that Transformer-XL outperforms state-of-the-art models on benchmark datasets, achieving significant improvements in perplexity and long-range dependency modeling. Notably, it achieves up to 1.8x faster evaluation speed compared to traditional transformers. The model\u2019s ability to handle longer contexts also translates to superior performance in downstream tasks such as text generation and language understanding.  \n\nThis work contributes a scalable and efficient solution to the challenge of fixed-length contexts in transformers, paving the way for more robust language models capable of capturing long-term dependencies. Transformer-XL\u2019s innovations have broad implications for NLP applications, including machine translation, summarization, and dialogue systems, where understanding extended contexts is crucial.  \n\n**Keywords**: Transformer-XL, language models, long-range dependencies, segment-level recurrence, relative positional encoding, NLP."}
{"text": "The accurate detection and recognition of texts in natural scenes remain challenging due to the variability in text appearance, background complexity, and lighting conditions. This paper addresses the problem by proposing a novel approach for verisimilar image synthesis, which generates highly realistic synthetic images containing diverse text instances. Our method leverages advanced generative models and domain adaptation techniques to create synthetic datasets that closely mimic real-world scenarios. By incorporating multi-scale text rendering, adaptive lighting effects, and context-aware background generation, the synthesized images exhibit enhanced realism and diversity. We evaluate the effectiveness of our approach using state-of-the-art text detection and recognition models, demonstrating significant improvements in performance on benchmark datasets. The results show that training with our synthetic data leads to better generalization and robustness compared to existing methods. This work contributes to the field of scene text understanding by providing a scalable and cost-effective solution for generating high-quality training data, with potential applications in autonomous systems, document analysis, and augmented reality.  \n\n**Keywords**: scene text detection, text recognition, synthetic data generation, generative models, domain adaptation, computer vision."}

{"text": "This paper addresses the challenge of predicting regression probability distributions in the presence of imperfect data, such as missing values, noise, or outliers. Traditional regression models often struggle to provide accurate probabilistic predictions under such conditions, limiting their applicability in real-world scenarios. To overcome this limitation, we propose a novel framework that leverages optimal transformations to preprocess imperfect data and enhance the robustness of regression models. Our approach integrates advanced techniques from statistical learning and optimization to identify transformations that minimize prediction errors while preserving the underlying data distribution. We evaluate the proposed method using synthetic and real-world datasets, comparing its performance against state-of-the-art regression models. Results demonstrate significant improvements in predictive accuracy and reliability, particularly in scenarios with high levels of data imperfection. The framework also exhibits scalability and adaptability across diverse domains, including finance, healthcare, and environmental modeling. This research contributes to the field of probabilistic regression by introducing a systematic approach to handling imperfect data, offering practical insights for applications requiring robust and interpretable predictions.  \n\n**Keywords**: regression analysis, probability distributions, imperfect data, optimal transformations, predictive modeling, robust learning."}

{"text": "This paper introduces Neural Jump Stochastic Differential Equations (NJ-SDEs), a novel framework for modeling complex systems that exhibit both continuous dynamics and discrete jumps. Traditional stochastic differential equations (SDEs) often struggle to capture abrupt changes or events, limiting their applicability in real-world scenarios such as financial markets, biological systems, and network traffic. To address this, we propose NJ-SDEs, which integrate neural networks with jump-diffusion processes to model both smooth transitions and sudden shifts in system behavior. Our approach leverages deep learning to learn the underlying dynamics and jump mechanisms directly from data, eliminating the need for predefined parametric assumptions. We evaluate NJ-SDEs on synthetic and real-world datasets, demonstrating superior performance in capturing complex dynamics compared to existing methods. The results highlight the framework's ability to accurately predict system behavior, even in the presence of irregular jumps. This work contributes a flexible and data-driven tool for modeling hybrid systems, with potential applications in finance, healthcare, and engineering. Key innovations include the seamless integration of neural networks with jump processes and the ability to generalize across diverse domains.

{"text": "This paper addresses the challenge of developing interpretable and efficient reinforcement learning (RL) models for continuous action spaces. Traditional RL approaches often struggle with balancing performance and interpretability, particularly in complex environments. To overcome this limitation, we propose a novel framework that leverages a mixture of interpretable experts (MoIE) to guide decision-making in continuous action domains. Our approach integrates multiple specialized models, each designed to handle specific aspects of the environment, enabling both high performance and transparency in decision-making. The proposed method employs a hierarchical architecture where a gating mechanism dynamically selects and combines the outputs of these experts based on the current state. We evaluate our framework on benchmark continuous control tasks, demonstrating its ability to achieve competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art RL algorithms while maintaining interpretability. Key findings indicate that the MoIE framework not only improves task performance but also provides insights into the decision-making process, making it suitable for applications requiring both accuracy and explainability, such as robotics and autonomous systems. This research contributes a scalable and interpretable solution for continuous action RL, bridging the gap between complex models and practical usability.  \n\n**Keywords**: reinforcement learning, continuous action spaces, interpretability, mixture of experts, hierarchical models, decision-making."}
{"text": "This paper addresses the challenge of multispectral image fusion, aiming to enhance image quality by combining complementary information from multiple spectral bands. We propose a novel adaptive approach based on Markov Random Fields (MRF) and edge-guided interpolation to achieve high-resolution fused images with preserved structural details. The MRF framework is employed to model spatial dependencies and ensure consistency across spectral bands, while the edge-guided interpolation technique adaptively refines the fusion process by prioritizing edge information. This dual strategy effectively minimizes artifacts and improves the accuracy of reconstructed images. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms existing techniques in terms of both visual quality and quantitative metrics, such as peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) and structural similarity index (SSIM). The adaptive nature of the approach ensures robustness across diverse datasets, making it suitable for applications in remote sensing, medical imaging, and computer vision. This work contributes to the field by introducing a computationally efficient and edge-aware fusion framework that advances the state-of-the-art in multispectral image processing.  \n\n**Keywords**: Multispectral image fusion, Markov Random Fields (MRF), edge-guided interpolation, adaptive approach, image reconstruction, remote sensing."}

The objective of this research is to overcome the limitations of traditional optimization-based methods, which often struggle with computational inefficiency and suboptimal performance on complex visual data. LSM leverages a data-driven approach to learn a low-dimensional subspace that captures the essential features of natural images, enabling efficient and accurate minimization of energy functions. The proposed method combines the strengths of deep learning and classical optimization techniques, employing a neural network to predict subspace parameters and a lightweight iterative solver to refine the results. Experimental evaluations on benchmark datasets demonstrate that LSM achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple low-level vision tasks, outperforming existing methods in terms of both accuracy and computational efficiency. The framework\u2019s ability to generalize across diverse datasets and its robustness to noise further highlight its practical applicability. This work contributes a scalable and versatile solution for low-level vision problems, with potential applications in medical imaging, autonomous systems, and real-time video processing.

This paper introduces a novel Deep Graph Embedding Network (DGEN) model designed to enhance the accuracy and robustness of face recognition systems. The proposed approach leverages graph-based representations to capture intricate relationships between facial features, enabling more effective feature extraction and classification. The DGEN model integrates a graph convolutional network (GCN) with a deep learning framework to encode both local and global facial structures, addressing limitations of traditional methods that often overlook relational dependencies. Experiments were conducted on widely used datasets, including LFW and CelebA, to evaluate the model's performance. Results demonstrate that DGEN achieves state-of-the-art recognition accuracy, outperforming existing methods by 3.5% on average. Additionally, the model exhibits improved robustness to variations in lighting, pose, and occlusion. The findings highlight the potential of graph-based embeddings in advancing face recognition technologies, offering significant implications for real-world applications in biometrics and surveillance.

{"text": "Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) have emerged as a powerful framework for generative modeling, but their training stability remains a critical challenge, often leading to suboptimal performance. This paper addresses the issue of instability in VAEs by proposing a novel re-parameterization strategy that enhances convergence and robustness during training. Our approach involves redefining the latent space representation and optimizing the variational lower bound through a modified loss function, which mitigates common issues such as posterior collapse and gradient instability. We evaluate the proposed method on benchmark datasets, demonstrating significant improvements in model stability, reconstruction accuracy, and sample quality compared to standard VAE implementations. Furthermore, our approach achieves competitive results in downstream tasks such as anomaly detection and data generation. The findings highlight the importance of re-parameterization in improving VAE performance and provide a practical framework for deploying stable generative models in real-world applications. This work contributes to the broader understanding of VAE optimization and opens new avenues for research in generative AI.  \n\n**Keywords**: Variational Autoencoders, generative modeling, re-parameterization, training stability, latent space optimization, anomaly detection."}

{"text": "This paper addresses the challenge of achieving realistic single-view 3D object reconstruction using unsupervised learning techniques. Traditional methods often rely on extensive labeled datasets or multi-view inputs, which are costly and time-consuming to acquire. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel unsupervised learning framework that leverages multiple unlabeled images of objects from diverse viewpoints. Our approach employs a deep neural network architecture combined with a self-supervised loss function to learn 3D representations without explicit supervision. The model is trained to predict 3D shapes from a single input image by exploiting geometric consistency across multiple views. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in terms of reconstruction accuracy and visual quality, outperforming existing unsupervised approaches. The proposed framework is computationally efficient and scalable, making it suitable for real-world applications such as augmented reality, robotics, and autonomous systems. This work contributes to advancing unsupervised 3D reconstruction by reducing dependency on labeled data and enabling more practical deployment in resource-constrained environments.  \n\n**Keywords**: 3D reconstruction, unsupervised learning, single-view reconstruction, deep learning, geometric consistency, self-supervised learning."}
{"text": "Dense video captioning, the task of generating detailed textual descriptions for events within a video, remains a challenging problem in multimedia understanding. This paper introduces a novel bi-modal transformer architecture that leverages both audio and visual cues to improve the accuracy and richness of video captions. Unlike traditional approaches that rely predominantly on visual data, our method integrates synchronized audio signals to capture complementary contextual information, enhancing the model's ability to describe complex events. The proposed architecture employs a dual-stream transformer framework, where one stream processes visual features extracted from video frames, while the other analyzes audio features from the corresponding audio track. These streams are fused using a cross-modal attention mechanism, enabling the model to dynamically align and utilize information from both modalities. Experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving significant improvements in caption quality and event localization. The results highlight the importance of audio-visual fusion in dense video captioning and provide insights into the potential of multi-modal learning for advanced video understanding tasks. This work contributes to the growing field of multimedia AI by offering a robust, scalable solution for generating detailed and contextually accurate video descriptions.  \n\n**Keywords**: dense video captioning, bi-modal transformer, audio-visual fusion, multi-modal learning, cross-modal attention, video understanding."}

{"text": "Profile face recognition remains a challenging task in computer vision due to the significant pose variations and limited discriminative features available in profile views. This paper proposes an attention-guided progressive mapping (APM) framework to enhance the accuracy and robustness of profile face recognition systems. The proposed approach leverages a novel attention mechanism to focus on salient facial regions, progressively refining feature representations across multiple stages. By integrating spatial and channel-wise attention modules, the framework effectively captures both local and global facial characteristics, even under extreme pose conditions. The method is evaluated on benchmark datasets, including [Dataset Name], and demonstrates superior performance compared to state-of-the-art techniques, achieving a [specific metric, e.g., 98.5% accuracy]. Experimental results highlight the framework's ability to generalize across diverse datasets and its robustness to variations in lighting, expression, and occlusion. The proposed APM framework not only advances the field of profile face recognition but also offers potential applications in security, surveillance, and human-computer interaction. Key contributions include the introduction of a progressive mapping strategy and the integration of attention mechanisms, which collectively improve feature discriminability and recognition accuracy.

{"text": "The accurate classification of radiology images is critical for medical diagnosis, yet the scarcity of labeled data poses significant challenges for supervised learning approaches. This paper introduces *NoTeacher*, a novel semi-supervised learning framework designed to address this limitation by leveraging unlabeled radiology images effectively. Unlike traditional teacher-student models that rely on a fixed teacher network, *NoTeacher* eliminates the need for a mean teacher, instead employing a dynamic self-training mechanism that iteratively refines pseudo-labels for unlabeled data. The proposed approach combines consistency regularization with a confidence-based filtering strategy to ensure robust and reliable pseudo-label generation. Experiments on benchmark radiology datasets demonstrate that *NoTeacher* achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming existing semi-supervised methods by a significant margin. The framework also exhibits strong generalization capabilities across diverse imaging modalities, including X-rays and MRIs. By reducing dependency on labeled data, *NoTeacher* offers a scalable and efficient solution for medical image classification, with potential applications in clinical decision support systems.

We implement this method using a gradient-based optimization algorithm, which demonstrates improved convergence rates compared to standard RL techniques. Experimental results on benchmark environments, including continuous control tasks and Atari games, show that our approach achieves competitive performance in terms of sample efficiency and policy stability. The proposed framework not only provides a deeper theoretical understanding of RL optimization but also offers practical advantages for real-world applications, such as robotics and autonomous systems.

{"text": "The proliferation of deepfake technology poses significant challenges to digital media integrity, necessitating robust detection methods. This paper addresses the critical problem of identifying deepfake videos by proposing a novel hybrid approach that combines EfficientNet, a lightweight convolutional neural network (CNN), with Vision Transformers (ViTs). The objective is to leverage the strengths of both architectures: EfficientNet's efficiency in feature extraction and ViTs' ability to capture long-range dependencies in video frames. Our method involves preprocessing video frames to extract spatial and temporal features, followed by a fusion mechanism that integrates CNN-based local features with transformer-based global context. Experiments are conducted on widely used deepfake datasets, including DeepFakeDetection and FaceForensics++, to evaluate the model's performance. Results demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves state-of-the-art accuracy, outperforming existing methods by 3.5% in detection rates while maintaining computational efficiency. The model also exhibits strong generalization capabilities across diverse deepfake generation techniques. This research contributes a scalable and effective solution for deepfake detection, with potential applications in cybersecurity, media verification, and digital forensics.

{"text": "This paper addresses the challenge of transferring learned policies across continuous control tasks with varying dynamics and state spaces. The objective is to develop a framework for learning state abstractions that enable efficient transfer learning in reinforcement learning (RL) settings. We propose a novel approach that leverages unsupervised learning techniques to identify low-dimensional, task-invariant representations of high-dimensional state spaces. Our method combines variational autoencoders (VAEs) with a reward-prediction auxiliary task to ensure that the learned abstractions preserve task-relevant information while discarding domain-specific details. Experiments are conducted on a suite of continuous control benchmarks, including robotic manipulation and locomotion tasks, to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed approach. Results demonstrate that our method significantly improves transfer performance compared to baseline methods, achieving higher sample efficiency and faster adaptation to new tasks. The key contribution of this work is a scalable and generalizable framework for state abstraction that bridges the gap between source and target domains in continuous control. This research has implications for real-world applications, such as robotics and autonomous systems, where transfer learning is critical for deploying RL agents in diverse environments.  \n\n**Keywords**: reinforcement learning, transfer learning, state abstraction, continuous control, variational autoencoders, robotics."}

{"text": "Accurate short-term forecasting of transit passenger flow is critical for optimizing public transportation systems and improving urban mobility. This paper introduces a novel Multi-Graph Convolutional-Recurrent Neural Network (MGC-RNN) model designed to address the challenges of capturing complex spatial-temporal dependencies in transit networks. The proposed approach integrates multi-graph convolutional layers to model diverse spatial relationships, such as station connectivity and passenger transfer patterns, with recurrent neural networks to capture temporal dynamics. By leveraging multiple graph structures, the model effectively represents the heterogeneous interactions within transit systems. Experiments conducted on real-world datasets demonstrate that MGC-RNN outperforms existing methods in terms of prediction accuracy and robustness. The results highlight the model's ability to handle irregular passenger flow patterns and adapt to varying network conditions. This research contributes to the field of intelligent transportation systems by providing a scalable and efficient solution for short-term passenger flow forecasting, with potential applications in real-time scheduling, resource allocation, and congestion management.  \n\n**Keywords**: transit passenger flow, short-term forecasting, multi-graph convolutional networks, recurrent neural networks, spatial-temporal modeling, intelligent transportation systems."}
{"text": "Electroencephalography (EEG) is a critical tool for studying brain activity, but its utility is often limited by noise and artifacts that corrupt the signal. This paper addresses the challenge of robust learning from corrupted EEG data by introducing a novel dynamic spatial filtering approach. The proposed method leverages adaptive spatial filtering techniques to dynamically isolate and enhance relevant neural signals while suppressing noise and artifacts in real-time. Unlike traditional static filtering methods, our approach adapts to the temporal and spatial characteristics of the EEG signal, ensuring robustness across diverse noise conditions. We evaluate the method using both synthetic and real-world EEG datasets, comparing its performance against existing state-of-the-art techniques. Results demonstrate significant improvements in signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and classification accuracy, particularly in scenarios with high levels of corruption. The proposed framework not only enhances the reliability of EEG-based applications, such as brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) and neurofeedback systems, but also provides a scalable solution for real-time processing. This work contributes to the field by offering a robust, adaptive, and computationally efficient method for handling corrupted EEG data, paving the way for more accurate and reliable brain activity analysis.  \n\n**Keywords**: EEG, dynamic spatial filtering, noise suppression, brain-computer interface, real-time processing, adaptive filtering."}
{"text": "Unsupervised Behaviour Analysis and Magnification (uBAM) is a novel approach to understanding and enhancing subtle behavioural patterns in video data using deep learning techniques. This research addresses the challenge of detecting and amplifying imperceptible behavioural cues, which are critical in applications such as healthcare, security, and human-computer interaction. Traditional methods often rely on supervised learning, requiring extensive labeled datasets, which are costly and time-consuming to obtain. In contrast, uBAM leverages unsupervised deep learning models to autonomously identify and magnify behavioural patterns without the need for labeled data. The proposed framework integrates advanced computer vision techniques, including spatiotemporal feature extraction and generative adversarial networks (GANs), to analyze and enhance subtle motions in video sequences. Experimental results demonstrate that uBAM outperforms existing methods in terms of accuracy and computational efficiency, achieving a 15% improvement in motion detection precision on benchmark datasets. Furthermore, the system\u2019s ability to operate without labeled data significantly reduces deployment barriers in real-world scenarios. The implications of this research extend to diverse fields, including medical diagnostics, where it can assist in early detection of neurological disorders, and surveillance, where it enhances anomaly detection. This work contributes a scalable, unsupervised solution for behaviour analysis, paving the way for broader adoption in resource-constrained environments.  \n\n**Keywords**: Unsupervised learning, behaviour analysis, deep learning, computer vision, motion magnification, GANs."}

This paper introduces **XtracTree**, a novel and straightforward method for validating the regulatory compliance of bagging-based models, such as Random Forests, in retail banking applications. The proposed approach leverages a simplified decision tree structure to approximate the behavior of complex bagging ensembles, enabling regulators to assess model fairness, transparency, and adherence to compliance standards. Unlike existing methods, XtracTree focuses on reducing computational complexity while maintaining high fidelity to the original model's decision-making process. Experiments conducted on real-world retail banking datasets demonstrate that XtracTree achieves comparable accuracy to traditional bagging methods while significantly improving interpretability and validation efficiency. The results highlight the method's potential to bridge the gap between model performance and regulatory requirements, offering a practical solution for financial institutions. This work contributes to the growing field of explainable AI in finance by providing a tool that ensures both model effectiveness and compliance, paving the way for broader adoption of machine learning in regulated industries.  \n\n**Keywords**: Bagging methods, Random Forests, retail banking, regulatory compliance, explainable AI, XtracTree, model validation."}

{"text": "Generalized Zero-Shot Learning (GZSL) aims to recognize objects from both seen and unseen classes by leveraging semantic information, such as attributes or textual descriptions. However, a significant challenge in GZSL is the visual bias problem, where models tend to overfit to seen classes, leading to poor performance on unseen classes. This paper proposes a novel domain-aware visual bias eliminating framework to address this issue. Our approach introduces a domain-aware feature alignment mechanism that explicitly reduces the bias between seen and unseen classes by aligning their feature distributions in a shared latent space. Additionally, we employ a dual-branch architecture to decouple the learning of class-specific and domain-specific features, ensuring robust generalization across domains. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets, including AWA2, CUB, and SUN, demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance, significantly improving the harmonic mean accuracy of seen and unseen classes. The proposed framework not only mitigates visual bias but also provides a scalable solution for real-world applications where unseen classes are prevalent. Key contributions include the domain-aware alignment strategy and the dual-branch architecture, which collectively enhance the generalization capability of GZSL models.  \n\n**Keywords**: Generalized Zero-Shot Learning, Visual Bias, Domain Adaptation, Feature Alignment, Dual-Branch Architecture, Semantic Embedding."}

This paper introduces a novel approach to enhance lung segmentation robustness by leveraging 3D Conditional Generative Adversarial Networks (3D cGANs) to simulate CT-realistic lung nodules. The proposed method generates synthetic lung nodules with diverse shapes, sizes, and textures, closely mimicking real-world clinical data. These synthetic nodules are integrated into existing lung CT datasets to create augmented training data, improving the generalization capability of segmentation models. Our experiments demonstrate that segmentation models trained on the augmented dataset achieve superior performance, particularly in handling complex nodule cases, compared to models trained on standard datasets.

{"text": "The cold-start problem in outfit recommendation systems poses a significant challenge, particularly when new users or items lack sufficient interaction data for accurate predictions. This paper addresses this issue by proposing a novel approach based on visual preference modeling. Our method leverages deep learning techniques to analyze user preferences through visual features extracted from clothing items, enabling personalized recommendations even in the absence of historical data. We introduce a hybrid model that combines convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for image feature extraction with collaborative filtering to capture user-item interactions. The system is trained on a large-scale dataset of fashion images and user preferences, ensuring robust performance across diverse styles and demographics. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach outperforms traditional recommendation methods, achieving a 15% improvement in recommendation accuracy for cold-start scenarios. Furthermore, the model exhibits strong generalization capabilities, making it suitable for real-world applications in e-commerce and fashion platforms. This research contributes to the field by providing a scalable and effective solution to the cold-start problem, enhancing user experience and engagement in outfit recommendation systems.  \n\n**Keywords**: cold-start problem, outfit recommendation, visual preference modeling, deep learning, convolutional neural networks, collaborative filtering, fashion recommendation."}
{"text": "Causal discovery from time-series data is a critical challenge in understanding complex systems, with applications ranging from healthcare to finance. Traditional methods often struggle with scalability and computational efficiency, especially when dealing with large datasets. This paper introduces *Amortized Causal Discovery* (ACD), a novel framework that leverages deep learning to infer causal graphs from time-series data efficiently. The proposed approach employs a neural network-based model trained to predict causal relationships across diverse datasets, enabling generalization to unseen data without requiring retraining. By amortizing the inference process, ACD significantly reduces computational overhead compared to traditional causal discovery methods. Experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that ACD achieves competitive accuracy in identifying causal structures while being orders of magnitude faster than existing techniques. The framework also incorporates robustness to noise and missing data, making it suitable for practical applications. This research contributes a scalable and efficient solution to causal discovery, paving the way for real-time analysis of dynamic systems. The implications of this work extend to domains such as predictive modeling, decision-making, and system diagnostics, where understanding causal relationships is paramount.  \n\n**Keywords**: causal discovery, time-series data, deep learning, neural networks, amortized inference, causal graphs."}

{"text": "This paper introduces a novel Frequency Domain Neural Network (FDNN) designed to address the challenge of fast and efficient image super-resolution. Traditional super-resolution methods often rely on spatial domain processing, which can be computationally intensive and time-consuming. To overcome these limitations, we propose a neural network architecture that operates directly in the frequency domain, leveraging the inherent efficiency of frequency-based transformations. The FDNN employs a combination of Fourier transforms and learnable convolutional layers to reconstruct high-resolution images from low-resolution inputs. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves significant improvements in both computational speed and image quality compared to state-of-the-art spatial domain approaches. Specifically, the FDNN reduces inference time by up to 40% while maintaining competitive peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) and structural similarity index (SSIM) metrics. The findings suggest that frequency domain processing offers a promising direction for real-time image enhancement applications, such as medical imaging, satellite imagery, and video streaming. This work contributes to the field by introducing a new paradigm for super-resolution that balances efficiency and performance, paving the way for future research in frequency-based deep learning techniques.  \n\n**Keywords**: image super-resolution, frequency domain, neural networks, Fourier transform, computational efficiency, real-time processing."}

Traditional methods often struggle with preserving fine details and maintaining structural consistency in complex textures. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel approach leveraging Diffusion Tensor-based techniques, which model image structures and textures more effectively. Our method employs a tensor-driven diffusion process to propagate information from intact regions into damaged areas, ensuring seamless reconstruction while preserving edges and textures. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach outperforms existing methods in terms of structural accuracy, visual quality, and computational efficiency. Key metrics, including peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) and structural similarity index (SSIM), show significant improvements across diverse datasets. The findings highlight the potential of Diffusion Tensor-based inpainting for real-world applications, particularly in scenarios requiring high precision and robustness.

{"text": "Probabilistic object detection (POD) is an emerging paradigm in computer vision that extends traditional object detection by incorporating uncertainty quantification into predictions. This paper defines the concept of POD and proposes a comprehensive evaluation framework to assess its effectiveness. The objective is to address the limitations of conventional object detection methods, which often lack the ability to express confidence levels or handle ambiguous scenarios. We introduce a probabilistic formulation that models object localization and classification as distributions rather than deterministic outputs. To evaluate POD systems, we develop a set of metrics that quantify both detection accuracy and uncertainty calibration, enabling a more nuanced understanding of model performance. Experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate the advantages of POD over traditional approaches, particularly in scenarios with high ambiguity or noisy data. The proposed framework provides a foundation for future research in probabilistic vision systems, with potential applications in autonomous driving, robotics, and medical imaging. This work contributes to the field by formalizing POD, offering a standardized evaluation methodology, and highlighting its practical benefits in real-world applications.  \n\n**Keywords**: probabilistic object detection, uncertainty quantification, computer vision, evaluation metrics, object localization, uncertainty calibration."}
{"text": "Hyperspectral imaging is a powerful tool for capturing detailed spatial and spectral information, but it is often corrupted by mixed noise, including Gaussian, impulse, and stripe noise, which degrades data quality and limits its applications. This paper addresses the challenge of unsupervised hyperspectral mixed noise removal by proposing a novel approach based on the Deep Image Prior (DIP) framework, enhanced with spatial-spectral constraints. Unlike traditional methods that rely on supervised learning or handcrafted priors, our approach leverages the inherent structure of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to reconstruct clean hyperspectral images without requiring labeled training data. We introduce spatial-spectral constraints to regularize the optimization process, ensuring that both spatial smoothness and spectral consistency are preserved during denoising. Experimental results on benchmark hyperspectral datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art unsupervised techniques in terms of noise removal accuracy and preservation of fine details. The proposed approach is robust to various noise types and levels, making it suitable for real-world applications in remote sensing, environmental monitoring, and medical imaging. This work contributes to the field by providing a flexible and effective unsupervised solution for hyperspectral image denoising, reducing the dependency on large labeled datasets and advancing the practical deployment of hyperspectral imaging technologies.  \n\n**Keywords**: Hyperspectral imaging, mixed noise removal, unsupervised learning, Deep Image Prior, spatial-spectral constraints, convolutional neural networks."}

Accurate detection of microaneurysms is critical for early diagnosis and treatment. This paper presents an improved approach for microaneurysm detection using deep neural networks (DNNs). We propose a novel architecture that combines convolutional neural networks (CNNs) with attention mechanisms to enhance feature extraction and localization in retinal fundus images. The model is trained and validated on a publicly available dataset, achieving state-of-the-art performance with a sensitivity of 92.5% and specificity of 94.8%. Comparative analysis demonstrates that our approach outperforms existing methods, including traditional image processing techniques and baseline deep learning models. The proposed system also addresses challenges such as low contrast and noise in retinal images, making it robust for real-world clinical applications. This research contributes to the advancement of automated diabetic retinopathy screening by providing a reliable and efficient tool for early microaneurysm detection, with potential implications for improving patient outcomes and reducing healthcare costs.  \n\n**Keywords**: microaneurysm detection, diabetic retinopathy, deep neural networks, convolutional neural networks, attention mechanisms, retinal imaging."}

{"text": "This paper presents an improved convergence analysis of Stochastic Variance-Reduced Policy Gradient (SVRPG) methods, which are widely used in reinforcement learning for optimizing policy parameters. While SVRPG has shown promise in reducing the variance of gradient estimates, existing analyses often rely on restrictive assumptions or fail to fully capture the method's efficiency. In this work, we address these limitations by introducing a refined theoretical framework that provides tighter convergence bounds under more practical conditions. Our approach leverages a novel analysis of the variance reduction mechanism and incorporates insights from non-convex optimization to establish improved convergence rates. Through extensive experiments on benchmark reinforcement learning tasks, we demonstrate that our theoretical improvements align with empirical performance, showcasing faster convergence and greater stability compared to prior methods. The findings highlight the potential of our refined analysis to enhance the design and application of policy gradient algorithms in complex, real-world scenarios. Key contributions include a deeper understanding of variance reduction in policy optimization and practical insights for improving algorithmic efficiency. Keywords: reinforcement learning, policy gradient, variance reduction, convergence analysis, stochastic optimization."}

Traditional gradient boosting methods often face challenges in handling massive datasets due to their sequential nature and high computational demands. To address this, we propose a parameter server-based architecture that enables asynchronous parallel processing, significantly reducing training time while maintaining model accuracy. Our approach leverages a distributed computing environment, where workers independently compute gradients and update model parameters asynchronously, minimizing communication overhead and synchronization delays.  \n\nWe evaluate *Asynch-SGBDT* on several benchmark datasets, demonstrating its superior performance in terms of training speed and scalability compared to existing synchronous and asynchronous gradient boosting implementations. Experimental results show that our framework achieves up to a 40% reduction in training time without compromising predictive accuracy. Furthermore, we analyze the impact of key parameters, such as learning rate and tree depth, on the system's performance and convergence behavior.  \n\nThe proposed framework offers a practical solution for deploying gradient boosting models in distributed environments, making it particularly suitable for applications in big data analytics and real-time decision-making systems. By combining the robustness of gradient boosting with the efficiency of asynchronous parallelism, *Asynch-SGBDT* represents a significant advancement in scalable machine learning techniques.  \n\n**Keywords**: Asynchronous Parallel Computing, Stochastic Gradient Boosting, Decision Trees, Parameter Server, Scalable Machine Learning, Big Data Analytics."}

{"text": "Interactive recommender systems (IRS) have gained significant attention for their ability to adapt to user preferences in real-time, often leveraging reinforcement learning (RL) techniques. However, the susceptibility of RL-based IRS to adversarial attacks poses a critical challenge, potentially undermining system reliability and user trust. This paper investigates the vulnerabilities of RL-based IRS to adversarial attacks and proposes a robust detection framework to mitigate such threats. We first analyze the impact of adversarial perturbations on the reward signals and decision-making processes of RL agents, demonstrating how subtle manipulations can lead to suboptimal or harmful recommendations. To address this, we introduce a novel detection mechanism that combines anomaly detection techniques with adversarial training, enabling the system to identify and counteract malicious inputs effectively. Experimental results on benchmark datasets show that our approach significantly improves the resilience of RL-based IRS, reducing the success rate of adversarial attacks by up to 75% while maintaining recommendation accuracy. The findings highlight the importance of integrating security measures into the design of interactive recommender systems and provide a foundation for future research on adversarial robustness in RL-driven applications.  \n\n**Keywords**: interactive recommender systems, reinforcement learning, adversarial attacks, anomaly detection, adversarial training, system resilience."}
{"text": "This paper introduces *Deep Latent Defence*, a novel framework designed to enhance the robustness of deep learning models against adversarial attacks. The primary objective is to address the vulnerability of neural networks to subtle, malicious perturbations in input data, which can lead to incorrect predictions. To achieve this, we propose a latent space-based defense mechanism that leverages unsupervised learning to identify and mitigate adversarial patterns before they propagate through the model. Our approach integrates variational autoencoders (VAEs) with adversarial training, enabling the model to learn a robust latent representation of input data while simultaneously detecting and neutralizing adversarial perturbations. Experimental results on benchmark datasets, including CIFAR-10 and ImageNet, demonstrate that *Deep Latent Defence* significantly improves model resilience, achieving state-of-the-art performance in adversarial accuracy compared to existing defense methods. Furthermore, the framework exhibits minimal computational overhead, making it suitable for real-time applications. The findings highlight the potential of latent space manipulation as a powerful tool for adversarial defense, offering a new direction for securing deep learning systems in critical domains such as cybersecurity and autonomous systems.  \n\n**Keywords**: adversarial defense, deep learning, latent space, variational autoencoders, robustness, cybersecurity."}

The increasing integration of distributed energy resources (DERs) and the growing complexity of grid operations necessitate advanced control strategies to maintain voltage stability and optimize reactive power management. *PowerGym* provides a scalable and realistic simulation platform for training and evaluating RL-based control algorithms, enabling researchers to develop solutions for real-world power system challenges.  \n\nThe environment incorporates high-fidelity models of distribution networks, including dynamic load profiles, DERs, and controllable devices such as capacitor banks and voltage regulators. A deep reinforcement learning framework is employed to train agents that can autonomously manage Volt-Var control, ensuring compliance with operational constraints while minimizing energy losses and voltage deviations. Experimental results demonstrate that RL agents trained in *PowerGym* outperform traditional rule-based and optimization-based methods, achieving significant improvements in system efficiency and stability.  \n\nThe key contribution of this work lies in the development of a standardized, open-source RL environment tailored for power distribution systems, which bridges the gap between theoretical research and practical implementation. *PowerGym* not only advances the state-of-the-art in Volt-Var control but also serves as a valuable tool for accelerating the adoption of AI-driven solutions in the energy sector.  \n\n**Keywords**: reinforcement learning, Volt-Var control, power distribution systems, distributed energy resources, deep learning, grid optimization."}

The objective is to enhance the ability of neural networks to generate accurate and contextually rich captions by effectively combining visual and textual features. We propose a novel approach that leverages tensor product operations to fuse multi-modal features, enabling the network to capture intricate relationships between image regions and corresponding textual descriptions. The methodology involves integrating tensor-based fusion layers into a (de)compositional network architecture, which decomposes complex visual inputs into interpretable components and recomposes them into coherent captions.

{"text": "This paper addresses the challenge of temporal hockey action recognition, a critical task for automated sports analytics. The objective is to accurately identify and classify player actions in hockey videos by leveraging temporal dynamics and spatial features. To achieve this, we propose a novel framework that integrates pose estimation and optical flow analysis. Pose estimation extracts key skeletal points from players, capturing spatial body configurations, while optical flow tracks motion patterns across consecutive frames to model temporal dynamics. These features are combined using a deep learning architecture designed to process multi-modal inputs effectively. The proposed method is evaluated on a comprehensive hockey action dataset, demonstrating superior performance compared to existing approaches. Results show significant improvements in action recognition accuracy, particularly for complex and fast-paced movements. The framework\u2019s ability to handle occlusions and varying camera angles further highlights its robustness. This research contributes to advancing sports analytics by providing a scalable and efficient solution for real-time hockey action recognition, with potential applications in coaching, player performance analysis, and broadcast enhancement.  \n\n**Keywords**: Action recognition, pose estimation, optical flow, hockey analytics, temporal modeling, deep learning."}
{"text": "Counterfactual explanations have emerged as a powerful tool for interpreting machine learning models by identifying minimal changes to input data that alter model predictions. However, their reliability is often compromised by uncertainty in model predictions and the challenge of detecting out-of-distribution (OOD) inputs, which can lead to misleading or invalid explanations. This paper addresses these critical issues by proposing a novel framework for uncertainty estimation and OOD detection tailored specifically for counterfactual explanations. Our approach integrates Bayesian neural networks and density estimation techniques to quantify prediction uncertainty and identify OOD samples, ensuring robust and trustworthy explanations. Through extensive experiments on benchmark datasets, we demonstrate that our framework significantly improves the reliability of counterfactual explanations compared to existing methods. Key findings reveal that ignoring uncertainty and OOD detection can lead to overconfident or erroneous explanations, while our proposed solution mitigates these risks effectively. The implications of this work extend to high-stakes applications such as healthcare and finance, where reliable interpretability is crucial. This research contributes a practical and theoretically grounded solution to enhance the trustworthiness of counterfactual explanations in real-world scenarios.  \n\n**Keywords**: Counterfactual explanations, uncertainty estimation, out-of-distribution detection, Bayesian neural networks, interpretability, machine learning."}
{"text": "Score-based methods have gained significant attention in machine learning for their effectiveness in generative modeling and density estimation. However, a critical limitation of these methods remains unexplored: their inability to detect isolated components and accurately estimate mixing proportions in multimodal distributions. This paper investigates the theoretical and practical implications of this limitation, demonstrating that score-based methods inherently struggle to distinguish between isolated modes and fail to recover the true mixing proportions in such scenarios. Through extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets, we validate this phenomenon and analyze its impact on model performance. Our findings reveal that this blindness arises due to the gradient-based nature of score estimation, which smooths out sharp transitions between isolated components. To address this issue, we propose a novel hybrid approach that combines score-based methods with density-aware clustering techniques, improving the detection of isolated modes and enhancing the estimation of mixing proportions. This work not only highlights a fundamental limitation of score-based methods but also provides a practical solution, advancing their applicability in complex, multimodal data settings.  \n\n**Keywords**: score-based methods, generative modeling, multimodal distributions, isolated components, mixing proportions, density estimation."}
{"text": "The rapid growth of large-scale brain imaging datasets presents significant challenges in analyzing and interpreting complex brain network data. This paper introduces an auto-encoding framework designed to efficiently model and analyze brain networks, enabling the extraction of meaningful patterns from high-dimensional neuroimaging data. Our approach leverages a deep learning-based auto-encoder architecture to encode brain network structures into low-dimensional latent representations, which are then decoded to reconstruct the original networks. This framework not only reduces computational complexity but also preserves critical topological features of brain connectivity. We evaluate the proposed method on multiple large-scale brain imaging datasets, demonstrating its ability to outperform traditional dimensionality reduction techniques in terms of reconstruction accuracy and computational efficiency. Furthermore, the latent representations generated by our model provide valuable insights into brain network organization, facilitating applications such as disease classification, biomarker discovery, and functional connectivity analysis. The results highlight the potential of auto-encoding brain networks as a powerful tool for advancing neuroimaging research and addressing the challenges posed by ever-growing datasets.  \n\n**Keywords**: brain networks, auto-encoder, neuroimaging, deep learning, dimensionality reduction, functional connectivity."}

{"text": "This paper explores the application of modern convex optimization techniques to medical image analysis, addressing the challenges of enhancing image quality, segmentation, and feature extraction in clinical diagnostics. The objective is to leverage the mathematical robustness of convex optimization to improve the accuracy and efficiency of medical imaging systems. We propose a novel framework that integrates advanced optimization algorithms, such as proximal gradient methods and alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM), with deep learning architectures to handle large-scale, noisy, and incomplete medical datasets. Our approach is validated through extensive experiments on publicly available medical imaging datasets, including MRI and CT scans. Results demonstrate significant improvements in image reconstruction quality, segmentation precision, and computational efficiency compared to traditional methods. The proposed framework achieves state-of-the-art performance, reducing reconstruction errors by up to 20% and improving segmentation accuracy by 15%. The study highlights the potential of convex optimization in advancing medical image analysis, offering a scalable and interpretable solution for real-world clinical applications. Key contributions include the development of a hybrid optimization-deep learning model and its application to diverse medical imaging tasks. This research paves the way for future innovations in medical diagnostics, emphasizing the synergy between mathematical optimization and artificial intelligence.  \n\n**Keywords**: convex optimization, medical image analysis, image segmentation, proximal gradient methods, ADMM, deep learning, MRI, CT scans."}

{"text": "Motion forecasting is a critical challenge in autonomous driving, requiring accurate prediction of future trajectories for multiple agents in dynamic environments. This paper introduces a novel approach to motion forecasting by learning lane graph representations, which capture the intricate relationships between road topology and agent behaviors. We propose a graph-based neural network architecture that leverages lane-level information to model the spatial and temporal dependencies of traffic participants. The model integrates lane connectivity, agent trajectories, and contextual features to generate probabilistic predictions of future motion. Experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of prediction accuracy and robustness, particularly in complex urban scenarios. The proposed method achieves significant improvements in metrics such as average displacement error and final displacement error. Furthermore, the interpretability of the lane graph representations provides valuable insights into the decision-making process of the model. This work contributes to the advancement of motion forecasting by emphasizing the importance of structured road representations and offers potential applications in enhancing the safety and efficiency of autonomous driving systems.  \n\n**Keywords**: motion forecasting, lane graph representations, autonomous driving, graph neural networks, trajectory prediction."}
{"text": "This paper addresses the challenge of discovering meaningful temporal abstractions, known as Eigenoptions, in reinforcement learning (RL) environments. Eigenoptions are options that align with the principal components of the environment's transition dynamics, enabling efficient exploration and hierarchical decision-making. We propose a novel approach leveraging the Deep Successor Representation (DSR) to automatically discover Eigenoptions without prior knowledge of the environment's structure. Our method combines the representational power of deep neural networks with the theoretical foundations of successor representations to identify and encode the intrinsic structure of the environment. Experiments conducted on grid-world and continuous control benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed approach outperforms traditional methods in terms of exploration efficiency and task performance. The results highlight the potential of Eigenoptions for improving sample efficiency and scalability in complex RL tasks. This work contributes to advancing hierarchical RL by providing a data-driven framework for discovering reusable temporal abstractions, with implications for applications in robotics, autonomous systems, and beyond.  \n\n**Keywords**: Reinforcement Learning, Eigenoptions, Deep Successor Representation, Temporal Abstractions, Hierarchical RL, Exploration."}

However, their vulnerability to adversarial attacks in real-world scenarios remains a critical concern. This paper investigates the robustness of state-of-the-art face recognition models against physical-world adversarial attacks. We propose a novel attack framework that generates adversarial perturbations capable of deceiving face recognition systems under varying environmental conditions, such as lighting, angles, and occlusions. Our approach leverages a combination of generative adversarial networks (GANs) and optimization techniques to craft robust adversarial examples that remain effective in physical settings. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves a high success rate in bypassing commercial face recognition systems, outperforming existing attack strategies. Furthermore, we analyze the transferability of adversarial examples across different models and datasets, highlighting the broader implications for system security. This research underscores the need for improved defense mechanisms and provides insights into the vulnerabilities of deep learning-based face recognition in real-world applications.  \n\n**Keywords**: adversarial attacks, face recognition, deep learning, physical-world attacks, generative adversarial networks, system security."}
{"text": "This paper presents a comprehensive study on the effectiveness of ImageNet pre-training for historical document image analysis, a critical task in digitizing and preserving cultural heritage. The objective is to evaluate whether pre-trained models on large-scale datasets like ImageNet can generalize well to the unique challenges of historical documents, which often suffer from degradation, varying layouts, and diverse scripts. We employ a systematic approach, leveraging state-of-the-art convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and transformer-based architectures pre-trained on ImageNet, followed by fine-tuning on historical document datasets. Our experiments compare the performance of these models against those trained from scratch, focusing on tasks such as text recognition, layout analysis, and character classification. Results demonstrate that ImageNet pre-training significantly improves model accuracy and convergence speed, particularly in scenarios with limited annotated historical data. Furthermore, we identify key factors influencing transferability, including dataset size, domain similarity, and architectural choices. The findings highlight the practical benefits of leveraging pre-trained models for historical document analysis, offering a cost-effective solution for institutions with limited resources. This study contributes to the field by providing empirical evidence and actionable insights for researchers and practitioners working on document digitization and preservation.  \n\n**Keywords**: ImageNet pre-training, historical document analysis, transfer learning, convolutional neural networks, transformer models, text recognition, layout analysis."}

{"text": "The assessment of retinal image quality is critical for accurate diagnosis and analysis in ophthalmology. This study evaluates the performance of retinal image quality assessment networks across different color-spaces to determine the most effective representation for automated quality evaluation. We propose a comparative framework that leverages convolutional neural networks (CNNs) trained on retinal images transformed into RGB, grayscale, and alternative color-spaces such as HSV and LAB. The networks are trained and validated on a publicly available dataset of retinal images, with quality labels provided by expert ophthalmologists. Our results demonstrate that networks operating in the LAB color-space achieve superior performance, with higher accuracy and robustness in detecting artifacts, blur, and illumination issues compared to RGB and grayscale representations. Additionally, we analyze the computational efficiency of each color-space transformation, highlighting trade-offs between accuracy and processing time. The findings suggest that the choice of color-space significantly impacts the effectiveness of retinal image quality assessment systems, with LAB offering a promising balance between performance and interpretability. This research contributes to the development of more reliable automated tools for retinal image analysis, with potential applications in telemedicine and large-scale screening programs.  \n\n**Keywords**: retinal image quality assessment, color-spaces, convolutional neural networks (CNNs), LAB color-space, ophthalmology, automated diagnosis."}
{"text": "Scene text detection, particularly for arbitrary-shaped text, remains a challenging task in computer vision due to the diverse and complex nature of text instances in real-world images. This paper introduces I3CL (Intra- and Inter-Instance Collaborative Learning), a novel framework designed to address these challenges by leveraging both intra-instance and inter-instance relationships. The proposed approach integrates a dual-branch architecture that collaboratively learns local and global features, enabling robust detection of text regions with varying shapes, scales, and orientations. The intra-instance branch focuses on refining the representation of individual text instances, while the inter-instance branch captures contextual relationships between neighboring text regions, enhancing the model's ability to distinguish closely spaced or overlapping text. Experimental results on benchmark datasets, including ICDAR2015, Total-Text, and CTW1500, demonstrate that I3CL achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming existing methods in terms of precision, recall, and F-measure. The framework's ability to generalize across diverse text scenarios highlights its potential for real-world applications such as document analysis, autonomous driving, and augmented reality. This work contributes to the field by introducing a collaborative learning paradigm that effectively balances local and global context, paving the way for more accurate and robust arbitrary-shaped text detection systems.  \n\n**Keywords**: Scene text detection, arbitrary-shaped text, collaborative learning, intra-instance, inter-instance, computer vision."}

{"text": "This paper introduces *Duodepth*, a novel approach for static gesture recognition leveraging dual depth sensors to enhance accuracy and robustness in human-computer interaction systems. The primary objective is to address the limitations of single-sensor setups, such as occlusion and limited field-of-view, which often degrade gesture recognition performance. *Duodepth* employs a synchronized dual-depth sensor configuration to capture complementary spatial information, enabling more comprehensive gesture representation. A custom deep learning model, integrating multi-view feature fusion and attention mechanisms, is developed to process the dual-sensor data effectively. Experimental results demonstrate that *Duodepth* achieves a recognition accuracy of 95.7% on a benchmark dataset, outperforming single-sensor baselines by 8.2% and state-of-the-art multi-sensor approaches by 3.5%. Additionally, the system exhibits improved robustness in challenging scenarios, such as varying lighting conditions and partial occlusions. The findings highlight the potential of dual-depth sensor configurations for advancing gesture recognition technologies, with applications in virtual reality, robotics, and assistive devices. This work contributes a scalable and efficient framework for multi-sensor gesture recognition, paving the way for future research in enhanced human-computer interaction systems.  \n\n**Keywords**: gesture recognition, depth sensors, dual-sensor systems, deep learning, human-computer interaction, multi-view fusion."}

The objective is to address the challenge of leveraging limited labeled data in machine learning tasks, where acquiring labeled datasets is often costly and time-consuming. We propose a novel SSL framework that integrates IPM-based GANs to enhance the quality of generated data and improve classification performance. Our approach employs a discriminator trained with IPM metrics, which provides more stable training dynamics and better generalization compared to traditional GANs. The method is evaluated on benchmark datasets, including CIFAR-10 and SVHN, using varying proportions of labeled data. Experimental results demonstrate that our IPM-based GAN framework achieves superior classification accuracy and robustness compared to state-of-the-art SSL methods. The findings highlight the potential of IPM-based GANs in reducing the dependency on large labeled datasets while maintaining competitive performance. This study contributes to advancing SSL techniques by introducing a stable and efficient training mechanism, with implications for applications in domains such as computer vision, natural language processing, and healthcare.  \n\n**Keywords**: Semi-Supervised Learning, Generative Adversarial Networks, Integral Probability Metric, Machine Learning, Data Efficiency."}

The primary objective of Res2Net is to address the limitations of existing architectures in capturing multi-scale features, which are crucial for tasks such as image classification, object detection, and semantic segmentation. Unlike traditional CNNs, Res2Net employs a hierarchical residual-like structure within a single residual block, enabling the network to extract features at multiple granularities. This approach significantly improves the model's ability to represent fine-grained details while maintaining computational efficiency.  \n\nThe proposed architecture is evaluated on several benchmark datasets, including ImageNet, COCO, and PASCAL VOC, demonstrating superior performance compared to state-of-the-art models such as ResNet and DenseNet. Experimental results show that Res2Net achieves higher accuracy with fewer parameters, making it both effective and efficient. Additionally, the architecture's scalability allows it to be easily integrated into existing frameworks for various computer vision tasks.  \n\nThe key contribution of Res2Net lies in its innovative multi-scale feature extraction mechanism, which provides a new direction for designing backbone networks. This research has significant implications for advancing computer vision applications, particularly in scenarios requiring detailed and diverse feature representations.

{"text": "Bayesian Optimization (BO) is a powerful framework for optimizing expensive-to-evaluate functions, widely used in hyperparameter tuning and experimental design. However, its performance heavily relies on the choice of acquisition functions, which guide the search process. Traditional acquisition functions are often designed for specific tasks, limiting their adaptability across diverse optimization problems. This paper introduces a meta-learning approach to automatically learn acquisition functions that generalize across tasks, enabling effective transfer learning in BO. We propose a novel framework that leverages meta-learning to train acquisition functions on a diverse set of optimization tasks, allowing them to adapt quickly to new, unseen problems. Our method employs a neural network-based meta-model that learns to predict acquisition values based on historical data, optimizing for both exploration and exploitation. Experimental results demonstrate that the meta-learned acquisition functions outperform traditional methods, achieving faster convergence and better final solutions across a variety of benchmarks. The proposed approach not only enhances the efficiency of BO but also reduces the need for manual tuning, making it more accessible for real-world applications. This work contributes to advancing transfer learning in BO by providing a flexible and adaptive solution for optimizing complex functions.  \n\n**Keywords**: Bayesian Optimization, Meta-Learning, Acquisition Functions, Transfer Learning, Neural Networks, Hyperparameter Tuning."}

This paper introduces a novel scene-specific pedestrian detection framework based on parallel vision, designed to enhance detection accuracy and adaptability across diverse environments. The proposed approach leverages a parallel computing architecture to simultaneously process multiple scene-specific models, enabling real-time adaptation to varying lighting, occlusion, and background conditions. By integrating a dynamic scene classification module and a multi-branch detection network, the system autonomously selects the most suitable detection model for the current scene, ensuring robust performance. Experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate significant improvements in detection accuracy compared to traditional single-model approaches, with a 15% increase in precision and a 12% reduction in false positives. The framework also exhibits superior computational efficiency, making it suitable for deployment in resource-constrained environments such as autonomous vehicles and surveillance systems.

{"text": "This paper introduces a novel Point-Based Multi-View Stereo Network (P-MVSNet) designed to address the challenges of 3D reconstruction from multi-view images. Traditional multi-view stereo (MVS) methods often struggle with computational inefficiency and limited scalability when handling dense point clouds. To overcome these limitations, we propose a lightweight, point-based approach that leverages deep learning to directly process sparse point representations, enabling faster and more accurate 3D reconstructions. Our method employs a hierarchical feature extraction framework combined with a differentiable point cloud optimization module, which refines the reconstructed geometry while maintaining computational efficiency. Experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate that P-MVSNet achieves state-of-the-art performance in terms of reconstruction accuracy and processing speed, outperforming existing methods by a significant margin. The proposed approach is particularly effective in scenarios with complex geometries and varying lighting conditions, making it a robust solution for real-world applications such as autonomous navigation, augmented reality, and digital twin creation. This work contributes to advancing 3D reconstruction technologies by introducing a scalable and efficient point-based paradigm, paving the way for future research in this domain.  \n\n**Keywords**: 3D reconstruction, multi-view stereo, point-based networks, deep learning, computational efficiency, hierarchical feature extraction."}

{"text": "Visual odometry (VO) is a critical component in robotics and autonomous systems, enabling the estimation of camera motion from sequential images. Despite significant advancements, challenges persist in achieving robust and accurate VO, particularly in dynamic and unstructured environments. This paper revisits the core principles of visual odometry and investigates what aspects should be learned to enhance its performance. We propose a novel learning-based framework that integrates traditional geometric methods with deep learning techniques to address key limitations in feature extraction, motion estimation, and error correction. Our approach leverages a hybrid architecture that combines convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for feature representation and recurrent neural networks (RNNs) for temporal consistency, enabling end-to-end training. Experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art VO systems in terms of accuracy and robustness, particularly in challenging scenarios with occlusions and lighting variations. The findings highlight the importance of learning both spatial and temporal dependencies in VO, offering new insights for future research. This work contributes to the advancement of autonomous navigation systems by providing a scalable and adaptable solution for real-world applications.  \n\n**Keywords**: Visual odometry, deep learning, feature extraction, motion estimation, autonomous navigation, hybrid architecture."}
{"text": "This paper addresses the challenge of disentangling complex image representations to uncover underlying structures and patterns. We propose a novel framework that combines Lie group transformations with sparse coding to achieve efficient and interpretable image decomposition. The objective is to separate images into meaningful components, such as texture, shape, and illumination, by leveraging the mathematical properties of Lie groups to model transformations and sparse coding to enforce parsimony in representation. Our approach involves constructing a hierarchical model where Lie group transformations are applied to capture geometric and photometric variations, while sparse coding ensures that the resulting representations are compact and discriminative. Experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms existing techniques in terms of reconstruction accuracy and interpretability, particularly in scenarios involving occlusions and noise. The proposed framework not only advances the state-of-the-art in image disentanglement but also offers practical applications in computer vision tasks such as object recognition, image synthesis, and medical imaging. Key contributions include the integration of Lie group theory with sparse coding, a scalable algorithm for efficient computation, and empirical validation of the method's robustness.

{"text": "Semantic segmentation is a critical task in computer vision, enabling precise pixel-level understanding of images. This paper introduces Gated-SCNN, a novel architecture that enhances semantic segmentation by explicitly modeling shape information through a two-stream CNN framework. The proposed method incorporates a shape stream, operating in parallel to the classical CNN stream, to capture fine-grained boundary details. A gating mechanism is introduced to facilitate effective interaction between the two streams, ensuring that shape information complements the traditional feature extraction process. Experiments on benchmark datasets, including Cityscapes and PASCAL VOC, demonstrate that Gated-SCNN achieves state-of-the-art performance, particularly in capturing object boundaries and improving segmentation accuracy. The results highlight the effectiveness of the gated shape stream in addressing the limitations of conventional CNNs, which often struggle with boundary delineation. This work contributes a robust and efficient solution for semantic segmentation, with potential applications in autonomous driving, medical imaging, and scene understanding.  \n\n**Keywords**: Semantic segmentation, Gated-SCNN, shape information, two-stream CNN, boundary detection, computer vision."}
{"text": "The growing reliance on speech command classification systems in applications such as virtual assistants and voice-controlled devices has raised concerns about their vulnerability to adversarial attacks. This paper investigates the existence and impact of universal adversarial examples in speech command classification, which are perturbations capable of misleading multiple models across different architectures. We propose a novel approach to generate such adversarial examples by leveraging gradient-based optimization techniques and transferability properties across diverse neural network models. Our experiments demonstrate that these universal perturbations can significantly degrade the performance of state-of-the-art speech classification systems, achieving high success rates across multiple datasets and model architectures. Furthermore, we analyze the robustness of these systems under adversarial conditions and identify key factors contributing to their susceptibility. The findings highlight critical security challenges in deploying speech-based systems and provide insights into developing more robust defenses against adversarial attacks. This work contributes to advancing the understanding of adversarial vulnerabilities in speech processing and underscores the need for improved resilience in voice-enabled technologies.  \n\n**Keywords**: adversarial examples, speech command classification, universal perturbations, neural networks, robustness, transferability."}
{"text": "This paper introduces HIGhER, a novel framework designed to enhance instruction-following capabilities in reinforcement learning (RL) agents through Hindsight Generation for Experience Replay. The primary objective is to address the challenge of sparse rewards and suboptimal performance in tasks requiring precise adherence to complex instructions. HIGhER leverages hindsight experience replay (HER) by generating synthetic hindsight instructions that align with the agent's observed trajectories, enabling more effective learning from past experiences. The proposed method integrates a generative model to dynamically create plausible instructions for failed episodes, which are then used to train the agent in a self-supervised manner. Experiments conducted on benchmark instruction-following environments demonstrate that HIGhER significantly improves task completion rates and generalization compared to traditional HER and other baseline approaches. Key findings reveal a 25% increase in success rates and enhanced adaptability to unseen instructions. The framework's ability to generate contextually relevant hindsight instructions not only accelerates learning but also reduces the reliance on extensive reward engineering. This work contributes to advancing RL in instruction-following tasks by providing a scalable and efficient solution for improving agent performance in real-world applications, such as robotics and autonomous systems.  \n\n**Keywords**: reinforcement learning, hindsight experience replay, instruction following, generative models, self-supervised learning, robotics."}

This study aims to develop a deep learning-based approach for predicting OID in DCIS patients using breast MRI data. We propose a convolutional neural network (CNN) model trained on a large dataset of annotated breast MRIs, incorporating both imaging features and clinical metadata. The model leverages advanced image preprocessing techniques and multi-modal data fusion to enhance predictive accuracy. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves superior performance compared to traditional radiomics-based approaches, with an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.92 on an independent test set. The model also identifies key imaging biomarkers associated with OID, providing interpretable insights for clinicians. This research contributes a novel, AI-driven tool for early detection of invasive disease in DCIS, potentially improving personalized treatment strategies and reducing unnecessary interventions. The findings highlight the potential of deep learning in advancing precision oncology and underscore the importance of integrating AI into clinical workflows for breast cancer management.  \n\n**Keywords**: deep learning, breast MRI, ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS), occult invasive disease, convolutional neural networks (CNN), precision oncology."}

{"text": "The classification of component functions in product assemblies is a critical task in manufacturing and design, enabling better understanding and optimization of complex systems. This paper addresses the challenge of accurately identifying the functional roles of components within assemblies by leveraging Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). Traditional methods often rely on manual feature engineering or simplistic models, which struggle to capture the intricate relationships and dependencies between components. We propose a novel GNN-based approach that models product assemblies as graphs, where nodes represent components and edges represent their spatial and functional relationships. Our method automatically learns hierarchical representations of components, capturing both local and global structural patterns. Experiments on a diverse dataset of product assemblies demonstrate that our approach outperforms existing methods in terms of classification accuracy and robustness. The results highlight the effectiveness of GNNs in handling the complexity and variability of real-world assemblies. This research contributes to advancing automated design analysis and has potential applications in areas such as reverse engineering, quality control, and intelligent manufacturing.  \n\n**Keywords**: Graph Neural Networks, Component Function Classification, Product Assemblies, Manufacturing, Automated Design Analysis."}
{"text": "Transfer learning has emerged as a powerful technique in machine learning, enabling models to leverage pre-trained knowledge for new tasks with limited data. However, the effectiveness of transfer learning is influenced by factors such as the volume of target domain data and the similarity between source and target domains. This study investigates the impact of these factors on model performance in transfer learning applications. We employ a systematic approach, utilizing pre-trained deep learning models and evaluating their performance across diverse datasets with varying data volumes and domain similarities. Our experiments demonstrate that higher data volumes in the target domain significantly improve model accuracy, while domain similarity plays a critical role in determining the extent of knowledge transfer. Notably, we identify a threshold of domain similarity beyond which performance gains diminish, providing practical insights for selecting appropriate source domains. The findings highlight the importance of balancing data availability and domain alignment in transfer learning, offering guidelines for optimizing model deployment in real-world scenarios. This research contributes to the growing body of knowledge on transfer learning by quantifying the interplay between data volume and domain similarity, with implications for applications in natural language processing, computer vision, and beyond.  \n\n**Keywords**: transfer learning, domain similarity, data volume, deep learning, model optimization, machine learning."}

{"text": "Curve text detection in natural scenes remains a challenging task due to the diverse shapes, orientations, and backgrounds of text instances. This paper addresses the limitations of existing methods by proposing a novel approach called Conditional Spatial Expansion (CSE), which enhances the robustness and accuracy of curve text detection. The proposed method leverages a multi-task learning framework that integrates text region prediction and spatial expansion to adaptively capture the geometric properties of curved text. Specifically, CSE employs a conditional mechanism to dynamically adjust the expansion process based on the local context, enabling precise localization of text boundaries even in complex scenarios. Experiments conducted on benchmark datasets, including CTW1500 and Total-Text, demonstrate that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance, with significant improvements in both detection accuracy and computational efficiency. The results highlight the effectiveness of CSE in handling irregular text layouts and its potential for real-world applications such as document analysis, scene understanding, and augmented reality. This work contributes to the field of text detection by introducing a scalable and adaptive solution that bridges the gap between traditional and curve text detection methods.  \n\n**Keywords**: Curve text detection, Conditional Spatial Expansion, multi-task learning, text localization, scene text recognition."}

{"text": "Reinforcement Learning (RL) has shown remarkable success in solving complex decision-making problems, yet the choice of discount factor remains a critical but often overlooked aspect of algorithm design. This paper investigates the role of the discount factor as a regularizer in RL, exploring its impact on learning stability, convergence, and generalization. We propose a novel framework that treats the discount factor as a tunable hyperparameter, enabling adaptive control over the trade-off between short-term rewards and long-term value estimation. Through extensive experiments on benchmark environments, we demonstrate that optimizing the discount factor as a regularizer significantly improves policy performance, particularly in scenarios with sparse rewards or high-dimensional state spaces. Our results reveal that this approach not only enhances learning efficiency but also mitigates overfitting and improves robustness to environmental uncertainties. The findings highlight the importance of rethinking the discount factor's role in RL and provide practical insights for designing more effective and generalizable learning algorithms.

{"text": "Semantic understanding of foggy scenes is a critical challenge in computer vision, particularly for applications like autonomous driving and surveillance, where adverse weather conditions degrade visibility and performance. This paper addresses the problem of improving semantic segmentation accuracy in foggy environments by leveraging synthetic data. We propose a novel framework that integrates domain adaptation techniques with a deep learning-based segmentation model, trained on a combination of synthetic foggy datasets and real-world clear-weather data. Our approach employs a generative adversarial network (GAN) to bridge the domain gap between synthetic and real-world foggy scenes, ensuring robust feature representation. Experimental results demonstrate significant improvements in segmentation accuracy compared to state-of-the-art methods, achieving a 12% increase in mean intersection-over-union (mIoU) on benchmark datasets. The proposed framework not only enhances performance in foggy conditions but also generalizes well to other weather-related distortions.

However, existing methods often struggle with effectively capturing localized attribute representations, which are crucial for fine-grained recognition. This paper introduces a simple yet highly effective approach for localized attribute representations in ZSL. Our method focuses on extracting and aligning attribute-specific features from localized regions of images, enhancing the model's ability to generalize to unseen classes. We propose a lightweight architecture that integrates spatial attention mechanisms to identify and emphasize attribute-relevant regions without requiring extensive computational resources. Experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming existing methods in both conventional and generalized ZSL settings. The results highlight the importance of localized attribute representations in improving zero-shot recognition accuracy.

{"text": "Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) is a widely used reinforcement learning algorithm for continuous control tasks. However, its performance often deteriorates in deterministic environments with sparse rewards, raising questions about its reliability and applicability. This paper investigates the root causes of DDPG's failures in such settings, focusing on its sensitivity to exploration strategies, reward sparsity, and deterministic dynamics. We propose a systematic analysis framework to evaluate DDPG's behavior, identifying key limitations such as premature convergence to suboptimal policies and inadequate exploration in sparse reward landscapes. To address these issues, we introduce an enhanced variant of DDPG that incorporates adaptive exploration mechanisms and reward shaping techniques. Experimental results demonstrate significant improvements in performance across benchmark environments, with our approach achieving higher success rates and more stable learning compared to the original DDPG. The findings highlight the importance of tailored exploration strategies and reward design in deterministic, sparse-reward settings, offering practical insights for improving reinforcement learning algorithms in similar scenarios. This research contributes to advancing the understanding of DDPG's limitations and provides a foundation for developing more robust reinforcement learning methods for deterministic environments.  \n\n**Keywords**: Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG), reinforcement learning, sparse rewards, deterministic environments, exploration strategies, reward shaping."}
{"text": "Point set registration is a fundamental problem in computer vision and robotics, with applications ranging from 3D reconstruction to autonomous navigation. Traditional methods often struggle with robustness in the presence of noise, outliers, or partial overlaps between point sets. This paper introduces a novel adversarial approach to point set registration, leveraging the strengths of generative adversarial networks (GANs) to improve alignment accuracy and robustness. Our method employs a dual-network architecture, where a generator network predicts optimal transformations for point set alignment, while a discriminator network evaluates the quality of the alignment by distinguishing between correctly and incorrectly registered point sets. Through adversarial training, the system learns to handle challenging scenarios, such as noisy data and partial overlaps, more effectively than conventional methods. Experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art techniques in terms of registration accuracy and computational efficiency. The proposed method also shows significant improvements in handling non-rigid transformations and large-scale point sets. This work contributes to advancing point set registration by introducing a robust, learning-based framework with potential applications in medical imaging, augmented reality, and robotics.  \n\n**Keywords**: point set registration, adversarial learning, generative adversarial networks (GANs), 3D reconstruction, non-rigid transformations, computer vision."}
{"text": "This paper presents a novel gamut-mapping framework designed to achieve color-accurate reproduction of High Dynamic Range (HDR) images across diverse display devices. The increasing adoption of HDR content in multimedia applications has highlighted the challenge of maintaining color fidelity when rendering images on devices with varying color capabilities. To address this, we propose a two-stage approach that combines perceptual color space transformation with adaptive gamut mapping. The first stage employs a perceptually uniform color space to ensure consistent color representation, while the second stage utilizes an adaptive algorithm to dynamically adjust color mappings based on the target display's gamut characteristics. Our framework is evaluated using a comprehensive dataset of HDR images and compared against existing gamut-mapping techniques. Results demonstrate significant improvements in color accuracy and visual quality, particularly in preserving fine details and avoiding color clipping. The proposed method also shows robustness across a wide range of display technologies, including OLED, QLED, and LCD. This research contributes to the advancement of HDR imaging by providing a scalable and device-agnostic solution for color reproduction, with potential applications in digital media, virtual reality, and medical imaging.  \n\n**Keywords**: HDR imaging, gamut mapping, color accuracy, perceptual color space, adaptive algorithms, display technologies."}

{"text": "The rapid evolution of fashion trends, driven by social media platforms, presents a significant challenge for automated trend analysis. This paper addresses the problem of extracting fashion trends from social media images by proposing a robust object detection framework that integrates unsupervised learning capabilities. The objective is to accurately identify and classify fashion items in diverse, unstructured social media content, enabling real-time trend analysis. Our approach leverages a hybrid model combining state-of-the-art object detection techniques with unsupervised learning algorithms to adapt to the dynamic and heterogeneous nature of social media data. The proposed system is trained on a large-scale dataset of fashion-related images, incorporating both labeled and unlabeled data to enhance its generalization ability. Experimental results demonstrate that the model achieves superior performance in detecting and categorizing fashion items compared to existing methods, with significant improvements in precision and recall metrics. Furthermore, the unsupervised learning component enables the system to identify emerging trends without requiring extensive labeled datasets. The findings highlight the potential of this approach for applications in fashion retail, marketing, and trend forecasting. This research contributes to the field by introducing a novel, scalable solution for fashion trend extraction, bridging the gap between computer vision and real-world social media analytics.  \n\n**Keywords**: Fashion trend analysis, object detection, unsupervised learning, social media, computer vision, trend forecasting."}

{"text": "CogView represents a significant advancement in text-to-image generation, leveraging the power of transformer-based architectures to bridge the gap between textual descriptions and high-quality visual outputs. The primary objective of this research is to address the challenges of generating coherent and visually realistic images from natural language inputs, a task that has traditionally struggled with maintaining semantic alignment and fine-grained detail. To achieve this, CogView employs a novel transformer-based framework that integrates hierarchical attention mechanisms and multi-scale feature extraction, enabling the model to capture both global context and local nuances in the generated images. The approach is trained on a large-scale dataset of text-image pairs, utilizing a combination of supervised and self-supervised learning techniques to enhance generalization and robustness. Experimental results demonstrate that CogView outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in terms of image quality, semantic consistency, and diversity, as validated through both quantitative metrics and human evaluations. The model\u2019s ability to generate highly detailed and contextually accurate images from complex textual prompts highlights its potential for applications in creative design, virtual reality, and AI-assisted content creation. This work not only advances the field of text-to-image generation but also provides valuable insights into the scalability and adaptability of transformer-based models for multimodal tasks.  \n\n**Keywords**: text-to-image generation, transformers, hierarchical attention, multimodal learning, AI models, semantic alignment."}
{"text": "This paper addresses the challenge of unsupervised feature learning by proposing a novel approach based on non-parametric instance-level discrimination. Traditional methods often rely on labeled data or predefined similarity metrics, limiting their applicability in scenarios where labeled data is scarce or unavailable. Our approach leverages a non-parametric framework to learn discriminative features directly from unlabeled data by treating each instance as a unique class. This enables the model to capture fine-grained distinctions between instances without requiring explicit supervision. We introduce a memory bank mechanism to efficiently store and retrieve instance representations, enabling scalable training on large datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple benchmark datasets for unsupervised feature learning, outperforming existing parametric and non-parametric approaches. The proposed framework also exhibits strong generalization capabilities, making it suitable for downstream tasks such as image classification and clustering. This work contributes to the advancement of unsupervised learning by providing a scalable and effective solution for instance-level feature discrimination, with potential applications in domains such as computer vision, natural language processing, and beyond.  \n\n**Keywords**: unsupervised learning, feature learning, instance-level discrimination, non-parametric methods, memory bank, representation learning."}

This paper introduces **RoIMix**, a novel framework designed to enhance underwater object detection by leveraging proposal-fusion among multiple images. The primary objective of RoIMix is to improve detection accuracy by effectively combining region proposals from diverse underwater scenes, thereby addressing the limitations of single-image detection methods.  \n\nThe proposed approach employs a multi-image fusion mechanism that integrates region proposals generated from multiple input images, utilizing a region-of-interest (RoI) alignment and feature aggregation strategy. This method enhances the robustness of object detection by capturing complementary information across different images, even in challenging underwater conditions. Experiments are conducted on benchmark underwater datasets, demonstrating that RoIMix achieves superior performance compared to state-of-the-art single-image detection methods. Key metrics, including precision, recall, and mean average precision (mAP), show significant improvements, particularly in scenarios with low visibility and occlusions.  \n\nThe findings highlight the potential of RoIMix to advance underwater object detection, offering a scalable solution for applications such as marine exploration, underwater robotics, and environmental monitoring. By addressing the unique challenges of underwater environments, this research contributes to the broader field of computer vision and provides a foundation for future work in multi-image fusion techniques.  \n\n**Keywords**: underwater object detection, RoIMix, proposal-fusion, multi-image fusion, region-of-interest alignment, computer vision."}
{"text": "This paper addresses the challenge of decision-making in non-stationary environments, where transition dynamics and rewards evolve over time. Traditional Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) often assume stationarity, limiting their applicability in real-world scenarios with dynamic conditions. We propose a worst-case approach to non-stationary MDPs using model-based reinforcement learning (MBRL), which explicitly accounts for uncertainty and variability in the environment. Our method leverages a robust optimization framework to model and adapt to non-stationarity, ensuring reliable performance even under adversarial conditions. We introduce a novel algorithm that iteratively updates the environment model and policy, balancing exploration and exploitation while minimizing regret in the worst-case scenario. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach outperforms existing methods in dynamic environments, achieving superior adaptability and robustness. The findings highlight the potential of our framework for applications such as autonomous systems, robotics, and financial decision-making, where non-stationarity is a critical factor. This work contributes to the advancement of reinforcement learning by providing a principled and scalable solution for non-stationary decision-making problems.  \n\n**Keywords**: Non-stationary MDPs, model-based reinforcement learning, worst-case optimization, dynamic environments, robust decision-making."}

This paper investigates the mechanisms of adversarial attacks and explores robust defense strategies to enhance the resilience of deep learning systems. We first categorize adversarial attacks into white-box, black-box, and physical-world scenarios, analyzing their methodologies and impacts on model performance. Next, we evaluate state-of-the-art defense techniques, including adversarial training, input preprocessing, and model regularization, highlighting their strengths and limitations. Through extensive experiments on benchmark datasets, we demonstrate the effectiveness of these defenses against diverse attack strategies. Our findings reveal that while no single defense is universally robust, a combination of approaches can significantly mitigate adversarial risks. This research contributes to the ongoing effort to secure deep learning systems, offering insights into the design of more reliable and trustworthy AI models. Key implications include improved model robustness for real-world applications such as autonomous vehicles, healthcare, and cybersecurity.  \n\n**Keywords**: adversarial examples, deep learning, adversarial attacks, defense mechanisms, model robustness, AI security."}

{"text": "Histopathological image analytics plays a critical role in medical diagnosis, yet domain adaptation remains a significant challenge due to variations in staining protocols, scanner types, and tissue preparation across different medical institutions. This paper addresses the problem of unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) for histopathological image analysis using Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). We propose a novel GNN-based framework that leverages the inherent structural relationships between image patches to align feature distributions across source and target domains without requiring labeled target data. Our approach constructs a graph representation of histopathological images, where nodes represent image patches and edges encode spatial and semantic relationships. The GNN is trained to minimize domain discrepancy through a combination of adversarial learning and graph-based feature alignment. Experimental results on benchmark histopathological datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art UDA techniques, achieving significant improvements in classification accuracy and robustness to domain shifts. The proposed framework not only advances the field of histopathological image analysis but also provides a scalable solution for domain adaptation in other medical imaging tasks. Key contributions include the integration of GNNs for UDA, a novel graph-based feature alignment strategy, and empirical validation on challenging histopathological datasets.

{"text": "Accurate segmentation of medical images, particularly for complex structures like the pancreas, remains a significant challenge in medical imaging and computer vision. This paper introduces *Attention U-Net*, a novel deep learning architecture designed to improve segmentation performance by incorporating attention mechanisms into the widely used U-Net framework. The proposed model leverages attention gates to focus on salient regions of the input image, enabling the network to prioritize relevant features while suppressing irrelevant information. This approach enhances the model's ability to handle variability in organ shape, size, and position, which are common in medical datasets. We evaluate the performance of Attention U-Net on a publicly available pancreas segmentation dataset, demonstrating superior results compared to traditional U-Net and other state-of-the-art methods. The model achieves higher accuracy and robustness, particularly in cases with low contrast or ambiguous boundaries. The findings highlight the potential of attention mechanisms to improve medical image segmentation, offering a promising direction for future research in automated diagnosis and treatment planning. Key contributions include the integration of attention gates into U-Net, a detailed analysis of their impact on segmentation performance, and a publicly available implementation to facilitate reproducibility. Keywords: medical image segmentation, attention mechanisms, U-Net, deep learning, pancreas segmentation."}

{"text": "This paper introduces Graph Convolutional Memory (GCM), a novel framework designed to enhance the performance of deep reinforcement learning (DRL) by leveraging structured memory representations. Traditional DRL approaches often struggle with scalability and generalization in complex environments due to their reliance on unstructured memory mechanisms. To address this, we propose GCM, which integrates graph convolutional networks (GCNs) to model relationships and dependencies within the memory structure, enabling more efficient information propagation and decision-making. Our approach is evaluated on a suite of benchmark tasks, including high-dimensional control and multi-agent environments. Experimental results demonstrate that GCM significantly outperforms existing memory-augmented DRL methods in terms of learning efficiency, stability, and adaptability to dynamic scenarios. The key innovation lies in the ability of GCM to capture and utilize relational information, which is critical for solving tasks requiring long-term dependencies and complex interactions. This work contributes to advancing DRL by providing a scalable and interpretable memory framework, with potential applications in robotics, autonomous systems, and multi-agent coordination.  \n\n**Keywords**: Graph Convolutional Networks, Deep Reinforcement Learning, Memory Augmentation, Multi-Agent Systems, Scalable Learning."}
{"text": "This paper addresses the challenge of digital image acquisition with the lowest possible sampling rate, leveraging the principles of compressed sensing (CS) and the novel ASBSR (Adaptive Sparse Basis Selection and Reconstruction) method. The objective is to minimize the number of samples required for accurate image reconstruction while maintaining high-quality visual fidelity. Traditional sampling methods often require a high sampling rate to avoid information loss, which can be resource-intensive. To overcome this, we propose the ASBSR method, which adaptively selects sparse bases tailored to the image content, enabling efficient sampling and reconstruction. The approach integrates advanced optimization techniques to ensure robustness and computational efficiency. Experimental results demonstrate that the ASBSR method significantly reduces the sampling rate compared to conventional methods, achieving comparable or superior reconstruction quality. Key findings include a 40% reduction in sampling requirements while maintaining a peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) within 2 dB of traditional approaches. The implications of this research are substantial for applications in medical imaging, remote sensing, and real-time video processing, where minimizing data acquisition is critical. This work contributes to the field by introducing an adaptive, content-aware sampling framework that bridges the gap between theoretical compressed sensing and practical implementation.  \n\n**Keywords**: Compressed sensing, image reconstruction, sparse sampling, ASBSR method, digital image acquisition, adaptive sampling."}
{"text": "Bimanual multi-object manipulation is a complex task in robotics that requires precise coordination and control. This paper introduces a novel approach leveraging disentangled attention mechanisms as intrinsic regularization to enhance the performance of bimanual manipulation systems. The proposed method addresses the challenge of simultaneously managing multiple objects by decoupling attention into task-specific and object-specific components, enabling more efficient and robust manipulation. We present a deep reinforcement learning framework that integrates disentangled attention with hierarchical control policies, allowing the system to dynamically allocate focus and adapt to varying task demands. Experimental results demonstrate significant improvements in task success rates and manipulation efficiency compared to traditional approaches. The disentangled attention mechanism not only reduces computational overhead but also enhances generalization across diverse object configurations and environments. This work contributes to advancing bimanual manipulation capabilities, with potential applications in industrial automation, assistive robotics, and beyond.  \n\n**Keywords**: bimanual manipulation, disentangled attention, intrinsic regularization, multi-object manipulation, deep reinforcement learning, robotics."}

{"text": "Medical image segmentation is a critical task in healthcare, enabling precise diagnosis and treatment planning. However, achieving accurate segmentation often requires extensive labeled data, which is costly and time-consuming to obtain. This paper addresses this challenge by proposing a novel consensus-based approach for medical image segmentation that leverages semi-supervised learning (SSL) and graph cuts. The objective is to enhance segmentation accuracy while minimizing reliance on labeled data. Our method integrates SSL with a graph-based optimization framework, where unlabeled data is utilized to refine segmentation boundaries and improve model generalization. The graph cuts algorithm is employed to enforce spatial consistency and incorporate prior knowledge, while SSL ensures robustness by iteratively refining predictions using a consensus mechanism. Experimental results on benchmark medical imaging datasets demonstrate that our approach outperforms existing methods in terms of segmentation accuracy and computational efficiency. The proposed framework achieves a significant reduction in the dependency on labeled data, making it highly practical for real-world medical applications. This work contributes to the field by introducing a scalable and efficient solution for medical image segmentation, with potential applications in automated diagnosis, treatment planning, and medical research.  \n\n**Keywords**: Medical image segmentation, semi-supervised learning, graph cuts, consensus mechanism, healthcare AI."}
{"text": "Anomaly detection is a critical challenge in various domains, including cybersecurity, healthcare, and industrial systems, where identifying rare and unexpected events is essential. This paper introduces a novel approach to anomaly detection using Memory Augmented Generative Adversarial Networks (MA-GANs). The proposed method enhances traditional GAN architectures by integrating a memory module that captures and stores prototypical patterns of normal data, enabling more robust discrimination between normal and anomalous instances. The memory module acts as a dynamic repository, allowing the model to retain and recall essential features during training and inference.  \n\nWe evaluate the MA-GAN framework on benchmark datasets, including image and time-series data, and compare its performance against state-of-the-art anomaly detection methods. Experimental results demonstrate that MA-GANs achieve superior detection accuracy, particularly in scenarios with imbalanced data distributions and complex anomaly patterns. The memory augmentation mechanism significantly improves the model's ability to generalize and detect subtle anomalies that are often overlooked by conventional approaches.  \n\nThis research contributes to the field by introducing a memory-enhanced GAN architecture that addresses key limitations in anomaly detection, such as overfitting to normal data and poor generalization. The proposed method has practical implications for real-world applications, including fraud detection, fault diagnosis, and medical imaging.

{"text": "The increasing complexity of air traffic management necessitates advanced solutions to ensure safety, efficiency, and scalability. This paper proposes a novel deep ensemble multi-agent reinforcement learning (DEMARL) approach for air traffic control (ATC), addressing the challenges of dynamic decision-making in high-density airspace. The objective is to optimize air traffic flow while minimizing delays and conflicts. The proposed method integrates multiple deep reinforcement learning (DRL) agents, each trained on distinct aspects of ATC, such as conflict resolution, trajectory optimization, and resource allocation. These agents collaborate through an ensemble mechanism, leveraging their individual strengths to achieve robust and adaptive control. The approach is evaluated using a high-fidelity air traffic simulation environment, with performance metrics including conflict resolution rate, delay reduction, and computational efficiency. Results demonstrate that DEMARL outperforms traditional ATC methods and single-agent DRL approaches, achieving a 25% reduction in delays and a 30% improvement in conflict resolution. The study highlights the potential of ensemble-based multi-agent systems in complex real-world applications, offering a scalable and adaptive solution for modern air traffic management. This research contributes to the advancement of intelligent transportation systems, with implications for improving safety and efficiency in global aviation networks.  \n\n**Keywords**: air traffic control, multi-agent reinforcement learning, deep reinforcement learning, ensemble learning, conflict resolution, trajectory optimization."}

{"text": "The rapid growth of digital content in Vietnamese has created a pressing need for efficient multi-document summarization (MDS) systems. MDS aims to condense information from multiple documents into a concise and coherent summary, which is particularly valuable in applications such as news aggregation, legal document analysis, and business intelligence. Despite the advancements in natural language processing (NLP) for high-resource languages, Vietnamese MDS remains understudied due to linguistic complexities and limited resources. This research addresses this gap by developing a robust Vietnamese MDS system tailored to the unique characteristics of the language.  \n\nThe primary objective of this thesis is to design and implement an effective Vietnamese MDS model that can handle diverse document sets while preserving key information and maintaining linguistic coherence. The research focuses on overcoming challenges such as lexical ambiguity, syntactic variations, and the lack of annotated datasets for Vietnamese. To achieve this, the study leverages state-of-the-art NLP techniques, including transformer-based architectures like BERT and its variants, fine-tuned for Vietnamese text. The system architecture integrates pre-processing modules for text normalization, sentence embedding generation, and redundancy reduction, followed by an extractive or abstractive summarization approach depending on the task requirements.  \n\nPreliminary results demonstrate the model's ability to generate high-quality summaries with improved accuracy and fluency compared to baseline methods. The research contributes to the field by providing a novel framework for Vietnamese MDS, along with a curated dataset to support future studies. The outcomes have practical implications for industries requiring efficient information extraction from large-scale Vietnamese text corpora.  \n\nIn conclusion, this thesis advances the understanding and application of MDS in low-resource languages like Vietnamese.

{"text": "This paper introduces the Projection Pursuit Forest (PPF) algorithm, a novel supervised classification method designed to enhance the accuracy and interpretability of high-dimensional data analysis. The objective of this research is to address the challenges posed by complex datasets, where traditional classification techniques often struggle with scalability and performance. The PPF algorithm leverages projection pursuit techniques to identify optimal low-dimensional subspaces that maximize class separability, combined with an ensemble of decision trees to improve robustness and generalization. The proposed approach is evaluated on multiple benchmark datasets, demonstrating superior classification accuracy compared to state-of-the-art methods such as Random Forests and Support Vector Machines. Key findings reveal that PPF achieves significant improvements in handling non-linear relationships and high-dimensional feature spaces, while maintaining computational efficiency. The algorithm\u2019s interpretability is further enhanced by its ability to highlight meaningful projections, providing valuable insights into the underlying data structure. This research contributes to the field of machine learning by offering a scalable and interpretable solution for supervised classification, with potential applications in domains such as bioinformatics, finance, and image recognition.

{"text": "Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA) aims to bridge the gap between labeled source domains and unlabeled target domains, enabling models to generalize effectively across different data distributions. However, existing UDA methods often rely on complex, computationally intensive architectures that hinder scalability and real-world deployment. This paper introduces *Light-weight Calibrator* (LWC), a novel, separable component designed to enhance UDA performance while maintaining computational efficiency. LWC operates as a plug-and-play module that can be integrated into existing UDA frameworks, leveraging lightweight calibration mechanisms to align feature distributions across domains without requiring additional supervision. Our approach employs a combination of adaptive normalization and domain-specific feature recalibration to minimize domain shift effectively. Experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that LWC achieves competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art methods, with significantly reduced computational overhead. The results highlight LWC's ability to improve domain adaptation accuracy while maintaining scalability, making it suitable for resource-constrained environments. This work contributes a practical and efficient solution to UDA, with potential applications in areas such as autonomous systems, medical imaging, and cross-domain data analysis.  \n\n**Keywords**: Unsupervised Domain Adaptation, Light-weight Calibrator, Feature Alignment, Computational Efficiency, Domain Shift, Adaptive Normalization."}

{"text": "Scene text recognition (STR) is a critical task in computer vision, enabling the extraction of textual information from images for applications such as document analysis, autonomous navigation, and augmented reality. This paper addresses the challenge of recognizing text in complex scenes from a two-dimensional (2D) perspective, where variations in font, orientation, and background clutter often degrade performance. We propose a novel approach that leverages a hybrid deep learning framework combining convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and transformer architectures to enhance feature extraction and sequence modeling. The method integrates spatial attention mechanisms to focus on relevant text regions while mitigating noise from non-textual elements. Experiments conducted on benchmark datasets, including ICDAR and COCO-Text, demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art accuracy, outperforming existing methods by 3.5% on average. Additionally, the model exhibits robust performance under challenging conditions such as low resolution and occlusions. The proposed framework not only advances the field of STR but also offers practical implications for real-world applications requiring reliable text extraction from diverse environments. Key contributions include the integration of 2D spatial reasoning with sequence modeling and the introduction of a lightweight yet effective attention mechanism.

The approach leverages machine learning techniques to model atomic environments, with a focus on preserving physical interpretability. Results demonstrate significant improvements in predicting energy and force calculations for diverse molecular and solid-state systems, outperforming traditional GAP models. The localized Coulomb descriptors also exhibit robustness in handling systems with varying charge densities, making them suitable for applications in materials science and molecular dynamics simulations.

{"text": "This paper introduces a novel approach to enhance feature representation in Fully Convolutional Networks (FCNs) by integrating Concurrent Spatial and Channel Squeeze & Excitation (cSCSE) mechanisms. The primary objective is to improve the network's ability to capture both spatial and channel-wise dependencies, which are critical for tasks such as image segmentation and object detection. Traditional FCNs often struggle with balancing spatial and channel information, leading to suboptimal feature extraction. To address this, we propose cSCSE, a lightweight module that concurrently applies spatial and channel attention mechanisms to recalibrate feature maps. The spatial component focuses on identifying salient regions, while the channel component emphasizes important feature channels, enabling the network to adaptively refine its feature representations.  \n\nExperiments were conducted on benchmark datasets, including PASCAL VOC and Cityscapes, to evaluate the effectiveness of cSCSE. Results demonstrate significant improvements in segmentation accuracy, with the proposed method outperforming baseline FCNs and other attention-based approaches. Specifically, cSCSE achieves a mean Intersection-over-Union (mIoU) improvement of 2.5% on PASCAL VOC and 1.8% on Cityscapes compared to standard FCNs. Furthermore, the module adds minimal computational overhead, making it suitable for real-time applications.  \n\nThe key contribution of this work lies in the concurrent integration of spatial and channel attention, which provides a more comprehensive feature refinement mechanism. This innovation not only enhances the performance of FCNs but also offers a generalizable framework for improving feature representation in other deep learning architectures.

{"text": "Text-to-image matching is a critical task in multimodal learning, aiming to align textual descriptions with corresponding visual content. Despite significant progress, existing methods often struggle with fine-grained alignment and robustness to adversarial perturbations. This paper introduces a novel adversarial representation learning framework to enhance text-to-image matching by leveraging adversarial training techniques. The proposed approach employs a dual-branch architecture, where one branch generates adversarial perturbations to challenge the model, while the other branch learns robust representations to resist such perturbations. We integrate a cross-modal attention mechanism to improve the alignment between textual and visual features, ensuring precise matching even in complex scenarios. Experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in terms of matching accuracy and robustness. The framework achieves a 5.2% improvement in Recall@K metrics compared to existing methods, showcasing its effectiveness in handling noisy and adversarial inputs. Furthermore, the learned representations exhibit strong generalization capabilities across diverse domains. This research contributes to advancing multimodal learning by providing a robust and scalable solution for text-to-image matching, with potential applications in image retrieval, content recommendation, and human-computer interaction.  \n\n**Keywords**: adversarial learning, text-to-image matching, multimodal learning, cross-modal attention, representation learning, robustness."}

{"text": "This paper explores the application of self-play reinforcement learning (RL) to a four-player game of imperfect information, addressing the challenges of multi-agent decision-making under uncertainty. The objective is to develop a robust and scalable RL framework capable of handling complex interactions and strategic behaviors in environments with hidden information. We propose a novel self-play training methodology that leverages deep Q-networks (DQN) and policy gradient methods, combined with opponent modeling techniques, to enable agents to adapt dynamically to diverse strategies. The approach is evaluated on a custom-designed four-player game, simulating real-world scenarios where players must infer hidden states and predict opponents' actions. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms traditional RL baselines in terms of win rates and strategic adaptability, achieving a 25% improvement in performance metrics. Furthermore, the trained agents exhibit emergent behaviors such as bluffing and coalition formation, highlighting the framework's ability to capture nuanced gameplay dynamics. The findings suggest that self-play RL can be effectively applied to multi-agent systems with imperfect information, offering potential applications in areas such as automated negotiation, strategic planning, and game AI development. This work contributes to advancing the understanding of RL in complex, multi-agent environments and provides a foundation for future research in scalable and adaptive decision-making systems.  \n\n**Keywords**: reinforcement learning, self-play, imperfect information, multi-agent systems, deep Q-networks, opponent modeling, strategic decision-making."}

This paper addresses these issues by proposing a novel approach based on Joint Translation-Stereo Learning (JTSL). The objective is to enhance depth estimation accuracy in nighttime scenarios by leveraging the complementary strengths of image translation and stereo matching.

Key findings include a 15% improvement in depth estimation accuracy compared to state-of-the-art nighttime stereo methods. The implications of this research are significant for applications such as autonomous driving, robotics, and surveillance, where reliable depth estimation in low-light conditions is critical.

This paper presents a novel group-skeleton-based approach to improve the accuracy and robustness of action recognition in such scenarios. The proposed method leverages skeletal data extracted from multiple individuals within a group, capturing both individual actions and their interactions. A multi-stream deep learning architecture is introduced, combining spatial, temporal, and relational features to model the intricate dependencies between group members. The spatial stream processes joint positions, the temporal stream analyzes motion dynamics, and the relational stream encodes inter-person dependencies using graph-based representations. Experiments were conducted on two benchmark datasets, NTU RGB+D and Kinetics, demonstrating superior performance compared to existing methods. The proposed approach achieved an accuracy improvement of 5.2% on NTU RGB+D and 3.8% on Kinetics, particularly excelling in scenarios with occlusions and crowded environments. The results highlight the effectiveness of group-skeleton-based modeling in capturing contextual information and improving recognition accuracy.

{"text": "Image-based table recognition has emerged as a critical challenge in document analysis, with applications ranging from digitizing historical records to automating data extraction in business workflows. This paper addresses the limitations of existing approaches by introducing a comprehensive framework that integrates data, model, and evaluation methodologies. We propose a novel dataset specifically designed for table recognition tasks, addressing the scarcity of diverse and high-quality annotated data. Our approach leverages a hybrid deep learning model combining convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for feature extraction and transformer-based architectures for structured prediction, enabling robust handling of complex table layouts. Experimental results demonstrate significant improvements in accuracy and robustness compared to state-of-the-art methods, with a 12% increase in F1-score on benchmark datasets. Furthermore, we introduce a standardized evaluation protocol to ensure fair and reproducible comparisons across different models. The findings highlight the importance of high-quality datasets and advanced model architectures in advancing table recognition systems. This research contributes to the broader field of document understanding by providing a scalable and generalizable solution for real-world applications.  \n\n**Keywords**: table recognition, document analysis, deep learning, convolutional neural networks, transformers, dataset, evaluation protocol."}

{"text": "The optimization of machine learning (ML) models within compilers is critical for achieving efficient execution across diverse hardware architectures. However, existing optimization techniques often require significant manual effort and are tailored to specific hardware or model types, limiting their scalability and adaptability. This paper introduces a novel approach to ML compiler optimization through transferable graph optimizers. We propose a graph-based framework that leverages graph neural networks (GNNs) to learn optimization policies directly from computational graphs, enabling the transfer of optimization strategies across different models and hardware platforms. Our method employs a reinforcement learning-based training paradigm to iteratively refine optimization decisions, ensuring adaptability to varying computational constraints. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach outperforms traditional handcrafted optimization techniques, achieving up to a 30% improvement in execution speed and a 25% reduction in memory usage across multiple benchmarks. Furthermore, the transferability of the learned optimizers is validated through cross-platform evaluations, showcasing their ability to generalize to unseen architectures. This work contributes a scalable and automated solution to ML compiler optimization, paving the way for more efficient deployment of ML models in heterogeneous computing environments.  \n\n**Keywords**: machine learning compilers, graph neural networks, transferable optimizers, reinforcement learning, computational graphs, hardware acceleration."}

{"text": "Heterogeneous face recognition (HFR) poses significant challenges due to the inherent differences in modalities, such as matching sketches to photos or infrared images to visible-light images. This paper addresses the limitations of existing HFR methods by proposing a novel framework based on Conditional Adversarial Networks (CANs). The objective is to enhance cross-modal feature representation and improve recognition accuracy across diverse modalities. Our approach leverages a conditional generative adversarial network (cGAN) architecture, which incorporates modality-specific conditioning to bridge the gap between heterogeneous domains. The network is trained to generate modality-invariant features while preserving discriminative characteristics essential for accurate recognition. Experiments are conducted on benchmark datasets, including CASIA NIR-VIS 2.0 and CUFSF, to evaluate the performance of the proposed method. Results demonstrate significant improvements in recognition accuracy compared to state-of-the-art techniques, achieving a 12% increase in Rank-1 identification rates. The proposed framework also exhibits robustness to variations in lighting, pose, and expression. This research contributes to the field of HFR by introducing a scalable and effective solution for cross-modal recognition, with potential applications in security, surveillance, and forensic analysis. Key innovations include the integration of conditional adversarial learning and the development of a unified feature representation framework.

{"text": "This paper establishes a precise mathematical connection between the Variational Renormalization Group (VRG) and deep learning, two frameworks that have independently driven significant advancements in statistical physics and machine learning, respectively. The objective of this work is to bridge the gap between these domains by demonstrating an exact mapping between the hierarchical structure of VRG and the layered architecture of deep neural networks (DNNs). We employ a theoretical approach, leveraging principles from statistical mechanics and optimization theory, to formalize the equivalence between the renormalization group transformations in VRG and the forward propagation process in DNNs. Our findings reveal that the iterative coarse-graining procedure in VRG corresponds to the feature extraction mechanism in DNNs, with each layer of the network representing a step in the renormalization process. This mapping not only provides a unified perspective on these frameworks but also offers insights into the interpretability and optimization of deep learning models. The results highlight the potential for cross-disciplinary applications, enabling the transfer of theoretical tools from physics to enhance the design and analysis of machine learning algorithms.

{"text": "This paper addresses the challenge of efficient feature sharing in cooperative LIDAR-based object detection systems, where bandwidth constraints often limit the performance of collaborative perception. We propose a novel Bandwidth-Adaptive Feature Sharing (BAFS) framework that dynamically optimizes the transmission of feature maps between connected vehicles based on available network resources. The framework leverages a lightweight encoder-decoder architecture to compress and reconstruct feature maps, ensuring minimal information loss while adapting to varying bandwidth conditions. A key innovation is the integration of a bandwidth-aware feature selection mechanism, which prioritizes the most critical features for object detection under constrained communication scenarios. Experiments conducted on a simulated cooperative driving dataset demonstrate that BAFS achieves a 15% improvement in detection accuracy compared to traditional fixed-bandwidth sharing methods, while reducing communication overhead by up to 40%.

{"text": "This paper addresses the challenge of bi-level image thresholding, a critical task in image processing for segmentation and object detection. Traditional methods often rely on entropy-based approaches, which may not fully capture the complexity of image data. To overcome this limitation, we propose a novel bi-level thresholding technique based on Kaniadakis entropy, a generalized statistical framework that extends classical entropy measures. The proposed method leverages the flexibility of Kaniadakis entropy to better model the underlying intensity distributions in images, enabling more accurate threshold selection. We evaluate the performance of our approach using a diverse set of benchmark images and compare it against conventional entropy-based methods, such as Shannon and Tsallis entropy. Experimental results demonstrate that the Kaniadakis entropy-based thresholding achieves superior segmentation accuracy, particularly in images with uneven illumination or complex textures. The proposed method also exhibits robustness to noise, making it suitable for real-world applications. This work contributes to the field of image processing by introducing a new entropy-based framework for thresholding, offering improved performance and broader applicability. Future research directions include extending this approach to multi-level thresholding and integrating it with machine learning techniques for enhanced image analysis.  \n\n**Keywords**: Bi-level thresholding, Kaniadakis entropy, image segmentation, entropy-based methods, image processing."}

The proposed method employs a lightweight convolutional neural network (CNN) to extract discriminative features from heterogeneous image pairs, followed by a robust matching algorithm that incorporates spatial constraints to enhance alignment accuracy. Experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of both registration accuracy and computational efficiency. The system achieves a significant reduction in processing time while maintaining robustness to noise and large-scale transformations. This research contributes to advancing remote sensing applications by providing a scalable and reliable solution for multimodal image registration, with potential implications for disaster management, urban planning, and environmental monitoring.  \n\n**Keywords**: Multimodal image registration, remote sensing, feature matching, deep learning, convolutional neural networks, geospatial analysis."}

{"text": "This paper addresses the challenge of blind inpainting for large-scale masks of thin structures, a critical task in image restoration and reconstruction. Traditional inpainting methods often struggle with preserving fine details and maintaining structural integrity, especially in scenarios involving complex, thin structures. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel framework that integrates adversarial learning and reinforcement learning (RL). The adversarial component ensures high-quality, realistic reconstructions, while the RL mechanism optimizes the inpainting process by dynamically refining the mask boundaries and enhancing structural coherence. Our approach is evaluated on diverse datasets, including medical imaging and satellite imagery, where thin structures such as blood vessels or road networks are prevalent. Experimental results demonstrate significant improvements in both visual quality and quantitative metrics compared to state-of-the-art methods. The proposed framework not only achieves superior inpainting accuracy but also exhibits robustness to varying mask sizes and shapes. This research contributes to advancing image restoration techniques, with potential applications in medical diagnostics, remote sensing, and computer vision.  \n\n**Keywords**: blind inpainting, thin structures, adversarial learning, reinforcement learning, image restoration, large-scale masks."}

This paper proposes a novel semi-supervised superpixel-based multi-feature graph learning framework to address these challenges. The objective is to improve classification accuracy by effectively leveraging both labeled and unlabeled data while reducing computational complexity. The proposed method first employs superpixel segmentation to group pixels into homogeneous regions, reducing redundancy and preserving spatial information.

{"text": "This paper introduces a novel approach to Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC) by integrating multi-armed bandit (MAB) algorithms to optimize the selection of summary statistics. Traditional ABC methods often face challenges in balancing computational efficiency and accuracy, particularly when dealing with high-dimensional data. The proposed framework, Multi-Statistic Approximate Bayesian Computation with Multi-Armed Bandits (MSABC-MAB), leverages the exploration-exploitation trade-off inherent in MAB algorithms to dynamically prioritize the most informative summary statistics during the inference process. By reducing the reliance on redundant or less informative statistics, MSABC-MAB significantly improves computational efficiency without compromising accuracy. Experimental results on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms conventional ABC approaches in terms of both runtime and parameter estimation precision. The findings highlight the potential of combining MAB strategies with ABC for scalable and robust Bayesian inference, particularly in scenarios with limited computational resources. This work contributes to the growing body of research on efficient probabilistic inference and opens new avenues for applying bandit-based optimization techniques in statistical modeling.  \n\n**Keywords**: Approximate Bayesian Computation, multi-armed bandits, summary statistics, Bayesian inference, computational efficiency, probabilistic modeling."}
{"text": "This study investigates the quantitative impact of domain knowledge on the performance of machine learning (ML) models, addressing a critical gap in understanding how domain-specific insights enhance predictive accuracy and generalization. We propose a systematic framework to measure the value of domain knowledge by integrating it into feature engineering, model architecture, and training processes. Using a combination of supervised and unsupervised learning techniques, we evaluate the performance of ML models across diverse datasets, including healthcare, finance, and natural language processing. Our results demonstrate that incorporating domain knowledge significantly improves model accuracy, reduces overfitting, and enhances interpretability compared to purely data-driven approaches. Furthermore, we quantify the trade-offs between the complexity of domain knowledge integration and the resulting performance gains. The findings highlight the importance of domain expertise in developing robust ML systems and provide actionable insights for practitioners seeking to optimize model performance. This research contributes to the broader ML community by offering a quantitative methodology to assess and leverage domain knowledge, paving the way for more effective and domain-aware AI solutions.  \n\n**Keywords**: domain knowledge, machine learning, feature engineering, model performance, interpretability, quantitative analysis."}

{"text": "This paper investigates the fundamental limits of ridge-regularized empirical risk minimization (ERM) in high-dimensional settings, where the number of features exceeds the number of observations. The objective is to characterize the generalization performance of ridge regression under such conditions, providing insights into the interplay between regularization, dimensionality, and sample size. We employ a rigorous theoretical framework based on random matrix theory and asymptotic analysis to derive precise bounds on the generalization error. Our approach reveals a phase transition phenomenon, where the performance of ridge-regularized ERM depends critically on the ratio of the sample size to the dimensionality of the data. The results demonstrate that ridge regularization effectively mitigates overfitting in high dimensions, but its efficacy is constrained by inherent limitations tied to the data structure and noise levels. Key findings include closed-form expressions for the optimal regularization parameter and the associated generalization error, which are validated through extensive numerical experiments. This work contributes to the theoretical understanding of high-dimensional learning and provides practical guidelines for tuning regularization in real-world applications.

{"text": "Time series forecasting is a critical task in various domains, including finance, healthcare, and energy management. Traditional autoregressive models, while effective, often suffer from slow inference speeds and error accumulation over long prediction horizons. To address these limitations, we propose NAST, a **Non-Autoregressive Spatial-Temporal Transformer** designed for efficient and accurate time series forecasting. NAST leverages a novel non-autoregressive decoding mechanism, enabling parallel predictions and significantly reducing inference time without sacrificing accuracy. The model incorporates spatial-temporal attention to capture complex dependencies across both time and feature dimensions, enhancing its ability to model intricate patterns in multivariate time series data. Experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that NAST outperforms state-of-the-art autoregressive and non-autoregressive baselines in terms of prediction accuracy and computational efficiency. Notably, NAST achieves up to a 30% reduction in inference time while maintaining competitive forecasting performance. The proposed framework offers a scalable solution for real-world applications requiring fast and reliable predictions, paving the way for further advancements in non-autoregressive time series modeling.  \n\n**Keywords**: Time Series Forecasting, Non-Autoregressive Models, Spatial-Temporal Transformer, Parallel Decoding, Multivariate Data, Computational Efficiency."}

{"text": "The growing complexity of neural networks has led to significant interest in model compression techniques, such as pruning, to improve efficiency without sacrificing performance. This paper investigates the provable benefits of overparameterization in model compression, focusing on the phenomenon of double descent and its implications for pruning neural networks. We first establish a theoretical framework to analyze how overparameterization influences the generalization capabilities of pruned models. Using this framework, we demonstrate that overparameterized networks exhibit a double descent risk curve, which can be leveraged to achieve better compression-performance trade-offs. Our experimental results validate these theoretical insights, showing that overparameterized models, when pruned, consistently outperform their underparameterized counterparts across various benchmarks. Furthermore, we propose a novel pruning algorithm that exploits the double descent behavior to identify optimal subnetworks with minimal loss in accuracy. The findings highlight the critical role of overparameterization in enabling efficient model compression and provide practical guidelines for designing lightweight yet high-performing neural networks. This work contributes to the broader understanding of neural network optimization and offers new directions for research in model efficiency and scalability.  \n\n**Keywords**: Overparameterization, Model Compression, Double Descent, Neural Network Pruning, Generalization, Efficiency."}

However, ensuring their robustness and reliability remains a critical challenge, particularly in scenarios where small input perturbations can lead to significant output variations. This paper addresses the problem of certifying the Lipschitz continuity of generative models, a key property that guarantees bounded sensitivity to input changes. We propose a novel framework for provable Lipschitz certification, leveraging advanced optimization techniques and theoretical insights to establish rigorous bounds on the model's behavior. Our approach is applicable to a wide range of generative architectures, including Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and Variational Autoencoders (VAEs). Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art certification accuracy while maintaining computational efficiency. Furthermore, we provide empirical evidence of the practical benefits of Lipschitz-certified models in enhancing robustness against adversarial attacks and improving generalization. This work contributes a foundational tool for deploying generative models in safety-critical applications, offering both theoretical guarantees and practical utility.  \n\n**Keywords**: Generative Models, Lipschitz Continuity, Robustness Certification, Adversarial Defense, GANs, VAEs."}

We propose an alignment-aware linear model that leverages geometric alignment to enhance the representation of shape collections. Unlike traditional methods that treat alignment and representation as separate steps, our approach integrates these processes into a unified framework, ensuring that shape variations are captured more accurately. The proposed model employs a novel optimization technique to simultaneously align shapes and learn a low-dimensional linear subspace that describes their intrinsic structure. Experiments on diverse shape datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms existing approaches in terms of reconstruction accuracy and computational efficiency. The results highlight the model's ability to preserve fine-grained details while reducing dimensionality, making it suitable for applications such as shape retrieval, animation, and 3D printing.

{"text": "Event cameras, known for their high temporal resolution and low power consumption, have emerged as a promising technology for dynamic vision tasks. However, processing event data efficiently while preserving motion-equivariant properties remains a challenge. This paper introduces Motion Equivariant Networks (MENs) enhanced by the Temporal Normalization Transform (TNT), a novel framework designed to address these limitations. The proposed approach leverages the inherent spatiotemporal structure of event data by incorporating motion-equivariant layers, ensuring that the network's responses are consistent with the underlying motion dynamics.

{"text": "Image processing metrics are widely used to evaluate the performance of algorithms in tasks such as image enhancement, segmentation, and reconstruction. However, these metrics often exhibit limitations that can lead to misleading conclusions about algorithm effectiveness. This paper investigates the common pitfalls and biases associated with popular image processing metrics, including PSNR, SSIM, and MSE, through a series of illustrative case studies. By analyzing real-world scenarios and synthetic examples, we demonstrate how these metrics can fail to align with human perceptual quality or task-specific requirements. Our findings reveal that over-reliance on traditional metrics can obscure critical insights, particularly in applications involving complex textures, dynamic ranges, or subjective evaluations. To address these challenges, we propose a framework for selecting and combining metrics that better reflect practical outcomes. This research highlights the need for more robust evaluation methodologies in image processing and provides actionable recommendations for researchers and practitioners to improve the reliability of their assessments.

This paper addresses the problem of achieving fairness in clustering by proposing a novel approach based on variational inference.

{"text": "This paper addresses the challenge of enhancing image resolution from multiple low-resolution (LR) frames, a critical task in applications such as medical imaging, surveillance, and satellite imagery. Traditional single-frame super-resolution (SR) methods often struggle with noise and limited information, while multi-frame approaches face computational complexity and alignment issues. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel **Double Sparse Multi-Frame Image Super-Resolution (DS-MFSR)** framework. Our approach leverages sparse representation techniques to efficiently model both the spatial and temporal redundancies across multiple frames. Specifically, we introduce a dual sparse coding mechanism that separately optimizes for intra-frame and inter-frame sparsity, enabling robust alignment and high-quality reconstruction. The proposed method integrates a lightweight deep learning module to refine the sparse representations and enhance detail recovery. Experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate that DS-MFSR achieves superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods, with significant improvements in peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) and structural similarity index (SSIM). The framework also exhibits reduced computational overhead, making it suitable for real-time applications. This research contributes a scalable and efficient solution for multi-frame SR, with potential applications in fields requiring high-resolution imaging under resource constraints.  \n\n**Keywords**: Super-resolution, multi-frame imaging, sparse representation, deep learning, image enhancement, computational efficiency."}

{"text": "Contrastive representation learning has emerged as a powerful approach for extracting meaningful features from unlabeled data. However, accurately estimating and optimizing mutual information (MI) between representations remains a significant challenge, often leading to suboptimal performance. This paper introduces a novel framework, *Decomposed Mutual Information Estimation (DMIE)*, which addresses this limitation by decomposing MI into interpretable components that capture both global and local dependencies in the data. Our approach leverages a combination of variational inference and contrastive learning techniques to estimate these components efficiently, enabling more precise optimization of representation quality. Experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that DMIE outperforms existing methods in downstream tasks such as classification and clustering, achieving state-of-the-art results with improved computational efficiency. The proposed framework not only enhances the interpretability of learned representations but also provides a scalable solution for large-scale datasets. This work contributes to the advancement of unsupervised learning by offering a principled and effective method for mutual information estimation, with potential applications in domains such as computer vision, natural language processing, and bioinformatics.  \n\n**Keywords**: contrastive learning, mutual information estimation, representation learning, unsupervised learning, variational inference."}

{"text": "Image classification models often exhibit a strong bias towards global image statistics, which can limit their ability to generalize across diverse datasets and real-world scenarios. This paper introduces **Permuted AdaIN (Adaptive Instance Normalization)**, a novel approach designed to mitigate this bias by dynamically adjusting feature representations during training. Unlike traditional methods that rely heavily on global statistics, Permuted AdaIN leverages instance-specific normalization combined with a permutation mechanism to encourage the model to focus on local and contextually relevant features. We evaluate our approach on multiple benchmark datasets, including CIFAR-10, ImageNet, and domain-shifted datasets, demonstrating significant improvements in classification accuracy and robustness. Experimental results show that Permuted AdaIN outperforms existing normalization techniques, particularly in scenarios with domain shifts or limited training data. The proposed method not only enhances model generalization but also provides insights into reducing over-reliance on global statistics in deep learning architectures. This work contributes to advancing image classification by offering a scalable and effective solution for improving model adaptability and performance in real-world applications.  \n\n**Keywords**: Image classification, Adaptive Instance Normalization, domain adaptation, deep learning, feature representation, generalization."}
{"text": "In the era of data-driven decision-making, sharing data across entities to track global trends often raises privacy and security concerns. This paper addresses the challenge of leveraging collective knowledge without compromising individual data privacy. We propose a novel decentralized online learning framework that enables entities to collaboratively learn global trends while keeping their data private. The approach employs a distributed optimization algorithm that allows participants to update their local models using only aggregated insights from others, eliminating the need for direct data sharing. Our method integrates federated learning principles with adaptive online learning techniques to ensure scalability and real-time adaptability in dynamic environments. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed framework achieves competitive performance compared to centralized approaches while maintaining data privacy. The system exhibits robustness in handling non-stationary data distributions and scales efficiently with increasing numbers of participants. This research contributes a privacy-preserving solution for decentralized trend tracking, with potential applications in finance, healthcare, and IoT systems. The framework\u2019s ability to balance privacy, accuracy, and scalability makes it a promising tool for collaborative learning in distributed environments.  \n\n**Keywords**: decentralized learning, online learning, federated learning, data privacy, global trend tracking, distributed optimization."}
{"text": "The detection and localization of inharmonious regions in images, where certain areas exhibit inconsistencies in color, texture, or lighting, is a critical challenge in image editing and computer vision. This paper addresses the problem of automatically identifying and localizing such regions to improve image harmonization tasks. We propose a novel deep learning-based framework that leverages a multi-scale feature extraction approach combined with a self-attention mechanism to effectively capture both local and global inconsistencies within an image. Our method employs a dual-branch architecture, where one branch focuses on low-level features such as color and texture, while the other analyzes high-level semantic information. To evaluate the performance of our approach, we conduct extensive experiments on a publicly available benchmark dataset, comparing it against state-of-the-art methods. Results demonstrate that our framework achieves superior accuracy in localizing inharmonious regions, with a significant improvement in precision and recall metrics. Furthermore, we showcase the practical applicability of our method in real-world image editing scenarios, where it aids in seamlessly harmonizing composite images.

{"text": "This paper introduces Dilated Spatial Generative Adversarial Networks (DS-GANs), a novel framework for ergodic image generation that addresses the limitations of traditional GANs in capturing fine-grained spatial details and generating diverse, high-quality images. The objective of this research is to enhance the ability of generative models to produce images with improved spatial coherence and ergodic properties, which are critical for applications such as medical imaging, satellite imagery, and artistic content creation. The proposed DS-GAN architecture incorporates dilated convolutions within the generator network, enabling the model to efficiently capture multi-scale spatial features while maintaining computational efficiency. Additionally, a spatial attention mechanism is integrated to prioritize salient regions during the generation process. Experiments conducted on benchmark datasets demonstrate that DS-GANs outperform state-of-the-art GAN variants in terms of image quality, diversity, and spatial consistency, as measured by metrics such as Fr\u00e9chet Inception Distance (FID) and Structural Similarity Index (SSIM). The results highlight the model's ability to generate ergodic images with realistic textures and coherent structures. This work contributes to the field of generative AI by providing a scalable and effective solution for applications requiring high-fidelity image synthesis. The proposed framework has potential implications for domains such as data augmentation, virtual reality, and automated content generation.  \n\n**Keywords**: Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), dilated convolutions, ergodic image generation, spatial attention, image synthesis, deep learning."}
{"text": "Image captioning, a critical task in computer vision and natural language processing, aims to generate descriptive text for visual content. While supervised methods have shown promise, they rely heavily on large annotated datasets, which are costly and time-consuming to produce. This paper explores the use of self-supervised learning, specifically rotation prediction, to enhance image captioning models without requiring extensive labeled data. We propose a novel framework that integrates rotation prediction as a pretext task to learn robust visual representations, which are then fine-tuned for caption generation. Our approach leverages a transformer-based architecture to encode both visual and textual features, enabling the model to capture intricate relationships between images and their corresponding descriptions. Experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that our method achieves competitive performance compared to fully supervised approaches, with significant improvements in caption quality and diversity. The results highlight the potential of self-supervision in reducing dependency on labeled data while maintaining high accuracy. This work contributes to advancing image captioning by introducing a cost-effective and scalable solution, with implications for applications in accessibility, content generation, and multimedia retrieval.  \n\n**Keywords**: Image captioning, self-supervised learning, rotation prediction, transformer models, computer vision, natural language processing."}

{"text": "Estimating treatment effects from observational data is a critical challenge in causal inference, particularly when dealing with high-dimensional and imbalanced datasets. This paper introduces a novel framework for treatment effects estimation by leveraging selective and balanced representation spaces. The proposed approach addresses the limitations of traditional methods, which often struggle with biased sample distributions and irrelevant features. Our method employs a two-stage process: first, a selective representation learning mechanism identifies and retains the most informative features, reducing noise and improving interpretability. Second, a balanced representation space is constructed using adversarial learning to minimize distributional discrepancies between treated and control groups, ensuring unbiased effect estimation. Experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate that our approach outperforms existing methods in terms of accuracy and robustness, particularly in scenarios with high-dimensional covariates and significant imbalance. The framework\u2019s ability to generalize across diverse datasets highlights its potential for real-world applications in healthcare, policy evaluation, and beyond. This work contributes to the field by providing a scalable and interpretable solution for treatment effects estimation, bridging the gap between causal inference and representation learning.  \n\n**Keywords**: treatment effects estimation, causal inference, representation learning, adversarial learning, high-dimensional data, imbalance correction."}
{"text": "Object detection systems are critical for numerous applications, yet they often face challenges in achieving both high clean average precision (AP) and adversarial robustness. This paper investigates the potential of feature alignment techniques to address these dual objectives. We propose a novel approach that leverages feature alignment to enhance the consistency of feature representations across different layers of a deep neural network, thereby improving both detection accuracy and resilience to adversarial attacks. Our method integrates feature alignment into the training pipeline of state-of-the-art object detection frameworks, such as Faster R-CNN and YOLO, without requiring significant architectural modifications. Experimental results on benchmark datasets, including COCO and PASCAL VOC, demonstrate that our approach achieves a notable improvement in clean AP while simultaneously enhancing adversarial robustness compared to baseline models. The findings suggest that feature alignment can serve as a lightweight yet effective strategy to bridge the gap between accuracy and robustness in object detection systems. This work contributes to the growing body of research on robust computer vision and provides practical insights for deploying reliable object detection in real-world scenarios.  \n\n**Keywords**: object detection, feature alignment, clean average precision, adversarial robustness, deep learning, computer vision."}

{"text": "Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have shown remarkable success in generating high-quality synthetic data across various domains. However, they often suffer from two critical challenges: catastrophic forgetting and mode collapse. Catastrophic forgetting occurs when a GAN loses previously learned information during training, while mode collapse leads to the generation of limited or repetitive outputs. This paper investigates these issues and proposes a novel approach to mitigate their impact. We introduce a dynamic regularization framework that adaptively balances the trade-off between stability and plasticity during training. Our method leverages a memory-augmented architecture and a diversity-preserving loss function to enhance the GAN's ability to retain learned patterns and explore diverse modes. Experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate significant improvements in both stability and output diversity, outperforming existing methods. The proposed framework not only addresses the limitations of current GAN training techniques but also opens new avenues for robust and scalable generative modeling. Key contributions include a theoretical analysis of the interplay between catastrophic forgetting and mode collapse, as well as a practical solution that can be integrated into existing GAN architectures. This research has implications for applications in image synthesis, data augmentation, and unsupervised learning, where reliable and diverse generative models are essential.  \n\n**Keywords**: Generative Adversarial Networks, Catastrophic Forgetting, Mode Collapse, Dynamic Regularization, Memory-Augmented Architecture, Diversity-Preserving Loss."}

{"text": "Skeleton-based human action recognition has gained significant attention due to its robustness and efficiency in representing human motion. However, designing optimal graph convolutional networks (GCNs) for this task remains challenging, as it requires careful consideration of spatial-temporal dependencies and graph structures. This paper introduces a novel neural architecture search (NAS) framework to automatically design effective GCNs for skeleton-based action recognition. Our approach leverages a differentiable search strategy to explore the optimal graph topology and network architecture, eliminating the need for manual design and hyperparameter tuning. The proposed method is evaluated on widely used benchmarks, including NTU RGB+D and Kinetics-Skeleton datasets, demonstrating superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods.

This paper proposes a novel approach to traffic control optimization by integrating a Boosted Genetic Algorithm (BGA) with Machine Learning (ML) techniques. The objective is to enhance the performance of traditional genetic algorithms in optimizing traffic signal timings, thereby reducing congestion and improving traffic flow. The proposed method leverages ML models to predict traffic patterns and dynamically adjust the fitness evaluation process within the BGA framework. This adaptive mechanism enables the algorithm to respond effectively to real-time traffic conditions. Experimental evaluations were conducted using simulated urban traffic scenarios, comparing the proposed BGA-ML approach with conventional genetic algorithms and other optimization methods. Results demonstrate significant improvements in traffic flow efficiency, with reductions in average waiting times and vehicle emissions. The study highlights the potential of combining evolutionary algorithms with ML for real-time traffic management, offering a scalable and adaptive solution for smart cities.

{"text": "This paper presents an empirical evaluation of a Q-Learning algorithm for model-free autonomous soaring, addressing the challenge of enabling unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) to efficiently exploit atmospheric thermals without prior environmental knowledge. The objective of this study is to develop and validate a reinforcement learning-based approach that allows UAVs to autonomously learn and adapt to dynamic thermal conditions. We propose a Q-Learning framework that leverages real-time sensor data to make decisions on flight path adjustments, optimizing energy gain from thermals. The algorithm is implemented in a simulated environment that replicates realistic atmospheric conditions, and its performance is evaluated against traditional rule-based soaring strategies. Results demonstrate that the Q-Learning algorithm achieves significant improvements in energy efficiency and flight duration, outperforming conventional methods by up to 25% in thermal exploitation. Furthermore, the model-free nature of the approach eliminates the need for pre-programmed environmental models, enhancing adaptability in unpredictable conditions. The findings highlight the potential of reinforcement learning in advancing autonomous soaring capabilities, with implications for applications in long-endurance UAV missions, environmental monitoring, and search-and-rescue operations. Key contributions include a novel Q-Learning-based framework for autonomous soaring and empirical evidence of its superiority over existing methods.

{"text": "This paper addresses the challenge of optimizing hyperparameters for Kernel Ridge Regression (KRR) in real-time applications, with a focus on traffic time series prediction. Traditional hyperparameter optimization methods often require extensive computational resources and are unsuitable for dynamic, time-sensitive environments. To overcome this limitation, we propose an efficient online hyperparameter optimization framework that leverages adaptive sampling and gradient-based techniques to dynamically adjust hyperparameters during model training. Our approach reduces computational overhead while maintaining high predictive accuracy. Experimental results on real-world traffic datasets demonstrate that the proposed method achieves a 20% improvement in prediction accuracy compared to static hyperparameter settings and outperforms existing online optimization techniques in terms of computational efficiency. The framework is particularly effective in scenarios with rapidly changing data distributions, making it a valuable tool for real-time traffic forecasting systems. This research contributes to the advancement of online learning methodologies and provides a practical solution for enhancing the performance of KRR in dynamic environments.  \n\n**Keywords**: Kernel Ridge Regression, hyperparameter optimization, online learning, traffic prediction, time series analysis, adaptive sampling."}

{"text": "Accurate traffic speed prediction is critical for intelligent transportation systems, yet it remains challenging due to the complex spatiotemporal dependencies and heterogeneous data frequencies in real-world traffic networks. This paper proposes a novel Multi-fold Correlation Attention Network (MCAN) to address these challenges. The objective of this research is to enhance traffic speed prediction accuracy by effectively capturing multi-scale spatiotemporal correlations and integrating heterogeneous data sources with varying frequencies. MCAN employs a hierarchical attention mechanism to model both local and global spatiotemporal dependencies, while a frequency-aware module dynamically adjusts to the varying update rates of traffic sensors. The model is evaluated on real-world traffic datasets, demonstrating superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods, with significant improvements in prediction accuracy under diverse traffic conditions. Experimental results show that MCAN reduces mean absolute error by 12.5% and root mean squared error by 9.8% on average. The proposed approach not only advances the field of traffic prediction but also provides a scalable framework for integrating heterogeneous data in spatiotemporal modeling. This research has practical implications for urban traffic management, route optimization, and real-time navigation systems.  \n\n**Keywords**: Traffic speed prediction, spatiotemporal modeling, attention mechanism, heterogeneous data, intelligent transportation systems."}

{"text": "This study investigates the impact of geometric feature performance in EEG classification tasks under varying levels of downsampling. The objective is to evaluate how reducing the temporal resolution of EEG signals affects the discriminative power of geometric features, which are critical for accurate classification in brain-computer interface (BCI) applications. We propose a systematic approach to analyze the robustness of these features by applying multiple downsampling rates to EEG datasets and comparing classification accuracy across different machine learning models, including support vector machines (SVMs) and convolutional neural networks (CNNs). Our experiments utilize publicly available EEG datasets, focusing on motor imagery and emotion recognition tasks. Results demonstrate that while downsampling generally reduces classification performance, certain geometric features exhibit higher resilience to resolution loss, maintaining competitive accuracy even at lower sampling rates. This finding highlights the potential for optimizing computational efficiency in real-time BCI systems without significantly compromising classification effectiveness. The study contributes to the field by identifying key geometric features that are less sensitive to downsampling, offering practical insights for designing lightweight and efficient EEG processing pipelines.

{"text": "This paper addresses the challenge of accurately evaluating the depth of metal surface defects using eddy current testing (ECT), a critical task in non-destructive testing (NDT) for industrial applications. Traditional methods often struggle with precision and robustness due to noise and complex defect geometries. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel approach leveraging deep residual convolutional neural networks (ResNets) to enhance depth estimation accuracy. Our method integrates ECT signals with a ResNet-based architecture, designed to extract high-level features and learn complex patterns from raw sensor data. The model is trained on a comprehensive dataset of simulated and experimental ECT signals, covering a wide range of defect types and depths. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach significantly outperforms conventional techniques, achieving a mean absolute error reduction of 30% in depth estimation. Furthermore, the model exhibits strong generalization capabilities across varying material properties and defect geometries. This research contributes to advancing NDT by providing a robust, data-driven solution for defect depth evaluation, with potential applications in quality control and predictive maintenance in manufacturing industries.  \n\n**Keywords**: Eddy current testing, metal surface defects, depth evaluation, deep learning, residual convolutional neural networks, non-destructive testing."}

{"text": "Semantic segmentation in video sequences is a critical task for applications such as autonomous driving, surveillance, and augmented reality. However, achieving real-time performance while maintaining high accuracy remains a significant challenge due to the computational complexity of existing methods. This paper introduces **GSVNet**, a novel framework that leverages **Guided Spatially-Varying Convolution** to enable fast and efficient semantic segmentation on video data. The proposed approach dynamically adapts convolutional operations based on spatial context, reducing redundant computations without sacrificing segmentation quality. GSVNet employs a lightweight guidance network to predict spatially-varying kernels, which are then applied to the input frames, enabling adaptive feature extraction. Experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate that GSVNet achieves state-of-the-art performance, with a **20% reduction in inference time** compared to existing methods, while maintaining competitive accuracy. The framework\u2019s efficiency and scalability make it suitable for real-time applications, particularly in resource-constrained environments. This work contributes a novel architecture that bridges the gap between speed and accuracy in video semantic segmentation, paving the way for more efficient video understanding systems.  \n\n**Keywords**: Semantic segmentation, video processing, spatially-varying convolution, real-time systems, deep learning, computer vision."}

{"text": "Image inpainting, the task of reconstructing missing or damaged regions in images, remains a challenging problem in computer vision. This paper introduces a novel approach leveraging frequency domain priors to enhance the quality and accuracy of image inpainting. Unlike traditional spatial domain methods, our technique exploits the inherent frequency characteristics of images to guide the reconstruction process. We propose a hybrid framework that combines frequency domain analysis with deep learning-based models to effectively capture both global and local structural information. The method involves decomposing the image into its frequency components, applying a tailored inpainting algorithm to the transformed data, and reconstructing the image in the spatial domain. Experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate that our approach outperforms existing methods in terms of visual quality and structural coherence, particularly for complex textures and large missing regions. The proposed method achieves a significant improvement in peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) and structural similarity index (SSIM) compared to state-of-the-art techniques. This work highlights the potential of frequency domain priors in advancing image inpainting, offering a robust solution for applications in medical imaging, photo restoration, and computer graphics.  \n\n**Keywords**: Image inpainting, frequency domain, deep learning, image reconstruction, computer vision."}

{"text": "Image-text matching is a critical task in multimodal learning, aiming to bridge the semantic gap between visual and textual data. This paper introduces a novel approach, Recurrent Visual Embedding (RVE), which treats visual objects in images similarly to words in sentences, enabling a more cohesive alignment between the two modalities. The proposed method leverages recurrent neural networks (RNNs) to encode visual objects sequentially, mimicking the sequential nature of textual data. By doing so, RVE captures fine-grained relationships between objects and words, enhancing the accuracy of image-text matching. Experiments conducted on benchmark datasets, such as MS-COCO and Flickr30K, demonstrate that RVE outperforms existing methods in terms of retrieval accuracy and cross-modal alignment. The results highlight the effectiveness of treating visual objects as sequential entities, offering a new perspective for multimodal representation learning. This work contributes to advancing image-text matching by providing a robust framework that aligns visual and textual semantics more effectively, with potential applications in image captioning, visual question answering, and multimedia retrieval.  \n\n**Keywords**: Image-text matching, recurrent neural networks, visual embedding, multimodal learning, semantic alignment."}

{"text": "The rapid evolution of neural architecture search (NAS) has highlighted the need for efficient and accurate neural predictors to evaluate candidate architectures. This paper introduces a novel approach, *Homogeneous Architecture Augmentation* (HAA), designed to enhance the performance and generalization capabilities of neural predictors. The proposed method leverages a unified framework to augment training data by generating synthetic architectures with homogeneous structural properties, ensuring diversity and representativeness in the training set. We employ a graph-based representation to model neural architectures and utilize a generative model to produce augmented samples that maintain consistency with real-world design patterns. Experimental results demonstrate that HAA significantly improves the predictive accuracy of neural predictors across multiple benchmark datasets, outperforming existing augmentation techniques by up to 15% in correlation metrics. Furthermore, the method exhibits robust generalization to unseen architectures, making it particularly valuable for large-scale NAS applications. The findings suggest that HAA not only enhances the efficiency of NAS but also provides a scalable solution for improving neural predictors in resource-constrained environments. This work contributes to the growing body of research on NAS by introducing a data-centric approach that bridges the gap between architecture diversity and predictor performance.  \n\n**Keywords**: Neural Architecture Search, Neural Predictor, Homogeneous Augmentation, Graph-Based Representation, Data Augmentation, NAS Efficiency."}

{"text": "Semantic scene completion (SSC) is a critical task in 3D vision, aiming to reconstruct a complete 3D scene with both geometry and semantic labels from partial observations. This paper addresses the challenge of improving SSC accuracy by introducing a novel depth-based approach that leverages position importance awareness. The proposed method focuses on enhancing the loss function to prioritize critical regions in the scene, ensuring more accurate reconstruction and semantic labeling. We present a Position Importance Aware Loss (PIAL) that dynamically weights the contribution of different spatial positions based on their significance in the scene. This approach is integrated into a deep learning framework that processes depth data to predict complete 3D voxelized scenes. Experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms existing approaches in terms of both geometric accuracy and semantic segmentation performance. The results highlight the effectiveness of position-aware loss in improving scene completion tasks, particularly in complex environments with occlusions and sparse inputs. This work contributes to advancing SSC by providing a robust solution for real-world applications such as autonomous navigation, augmented reality, and robotics.  \n\n**Keywords**: Semantic Scene Completion, Depth Data, Position Importance Aware Loss, 3D Reconstruction, Deep Learning, Autonomous Navigation."}
{"text": "The rapid growth of interconnected data in the form of event and knowledge graphs has created a pressing need for methods to predict their co-evolution. This paper addresses the challenge of modeling the dynamic interplay between these two types of graphs, which are critical for applications such as real-time decision-making, recommendation systems, and knowledge base updates. We propose a novel hybrid approach that combines graph neural networks (GNNs) with temporal modeling techniques to capture both structural dependencies and temporal dynamics. Our method leverages multi-relational graph embeddings to represent events and knowledge entities, while a recurrent architecture predicts future graph states. Experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that our approach outperforms existing methods in terms of prediction accuracy and scalability. Key findings reveal that incorporating temporal context significantly improves the ability to forecast graph evolution, particularly for sparse or rapidly changing data. The proposed framework not only advances the state-of-the-art in graph-based prediction but also offers practical insights for applications requiring real-time knowledge integration. This research contributes to the broader field of dynamic graph analysis by providing a scalable and interpretable solution for co-evolution prediction.  \n\n**Keywords**: event graphs, knowledge graphs, graph neural networks, temporal modeling, co-evolution prediction, dynamic graph analysis."}

{"text": "This study addresses the challenge of road surface translation under snow-covered conditions and its implications for snow hazard assessment. The objective is to develop a robust framework for accurately translating snow-covered road surfaces into clear, interpretable representations while leveraging semantic segmentation techniques to compute a Snow Hazard Index (SHI). We propose a novel deep learning-based approach that integrates image-to-image translation models with advanced semantic segmentation networks. The translation model is trained to remove snow artifacts and reconstruct road surfaces, while the segmentation network identifies key road features and snow accumulation patterns. Our method is evaluated on a diverse dataset of snow-covered road images, demonstrating significant improvements in reconstruction accuracy and segmentation performance compared to existing techniques. The derived SHI provides a quantitative measure of snow-related hazards, enabling better decision-making for road maintenance and safety. The results highlight the potential of this approach for real-world applications in intelligent transportation systems and winter road management.

{"text": "Open Set Recognition (OSR) addresses the challenge of classifying known classes while identifying unknown or unseen data during inference, a critical requirement for real-world applications. This paper proposes a novel collective decision framework for OSR, leveraging ensemble learning to enhance robustness and accuracy in identifying both known and unknown classes.

{"text": "Bayesian regression tree models are widely used for their flexibility in capturing complex, non-linear relationships in data. However, traditional Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods for fitting these models often suffer from computational inefficiencies, particularly in high-dimensional settings. This paper introduces a novel continuous-time birth-death MCMC framework designed to address these challenges. The proposed approach leverages continuous-time stochastic processes to efficiently explore the space of regression tree structures, enabling faster convergence and improved scalability compared to conventional discrete-time MCMC methods. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method through extensive simulations and real-world datasets, showing significant reductions in computational time while maintaining or improving predictive accuracy. The framework also provides a principled way to handle uncertainty in tree structures, offering more robust posterior inference. This work contributes to the growing literature on scalable Bayesian methods, with potential applications in large-scale data analysis, decision-making systems, and interpretable machine learning. Key innovations include the integration of continuous-time dynamics into tree-based models and a computationally efficient sampling algorithm.

{"text": "This paper addresses the challenge of learning graphical models from observed data generated by the Glauber dynamics, a widely used Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method for sampling from complex distributions. The objective is to develop an efficient algorithm that can infer the underlying graph structure and parameters of the model solely from the dynamics' output. We propose a novel approach that leverages the temporal dependencies in the Glauber dynamics to estimate the conditional independence relationships between variables, enabling the reconstruction of the graphical model. Our method combines statistical techniques with optimization strategies to ensure scalability and robustness, even in high-dimensional settings. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach outperforms existing methods in terms of accuracy and computational efficiency, particularly for sparse graphs. The findings highlight the potential of utilizing MCMC dynamics for learning graphical models, offering a new perspective on structure learning in probabilistic graphical models. This research contributes to advancing applications in areas such as network inference, causal discovery, and machine learning, where understanding dependencies among variables is critical.  \n\n**Keywords**: Graphical models, Glauber dynamics, Markov chain Monte Carlo, structure learning, high-dimensional inference."}
{"text": "The accurate detection and recognition of traffic signs in road images are critical for autonomous driving systems and advanced driver-assistance systems (ADAS). However, the scarcity of diverse and annotated datasets, particularly for rare or uncommon traffic signs, poses a significant challenge. This paper addresses this issue by proposing a novel approach for augmenting road images with synthetic traffic signs using neural networks. The proposed method leverages generative adversarial networks (GANs) to create realistic synthetic traffic signs, which are seamlessly integrated into real-world road scenes. A two-stage pipeline is employed: first, a GAN-based model generates high-quality synthetic traffic signs, and second, a neural network-based blending algorithm ensures natural integration into the background. The augmented dataset is evaluated using state-of-the-art object detection models, demonstrating significant improvements in detection accuracy and robustness, especially for underrepresented traffic sign classes. Experimental results show that the proposed method enhances model performance by up to 15% compared to traditional augmentation techniques. This work contributes to the field by providing a scalable and efficient solution for dataset enrichment, enabling more reliable traffic sign recognition systems. The implications of this research extend to improving the safety and reliability of autonomous vehicles and ADAS technologies.  \n\n**Keywords**: traffic sign detection, synthetic data generation, GANs, neural networks, dataset augmentation, autonomous driving."}

{"text": "This paper presents a comprehensive survey of optimization methods from a machine learning (ML) perspective, focusing on their applications, challenges, and advancements. The objective is to provide a structured overview of optimization techniques tailored for ML tasks, addressing the growing need for efficient and scalable solutions in training complex models. We categorize optimization methods into classical approaches, such as gradient-based methods, and modern techniques, including stochastic optimization, adaptive learning rate algorithms, and metaheuristic approaches. The survey highlights key innovations, such as the integration of second-order optimization methods and the use of distributed computing frameworks to handle large-scale datasets. Results from comparative studies demonstrate the effectiveness of these methods in improving convergence rates, reducing computational costs, and enhancing model performance across various ML applications. The paper concludes with insights into emerging trends, such as the interplay between optimization and deep learning architectures, and the potential for hybrid methods to address non-convex optimization challenges. This survey contributes to the ML community by offering a unified perspective on optimization techniques, enabling researchers and practitioners to select and adapt methods for specific problem domains. Keywords: optimization, machine learning, gradient descent, stochastic optimization, adaptive learning, metaheuristics."}
{"text": "This paper addresses the challenge of enabling artificial intelligence (AI) systems to autonomously learn effective teaching strategies, a critical step toward developing intelligent tutoring systems and personalized education platforms. We propose a novel framework, *Learning to Teach* (L2T), which leverages reinforcement learning to train AI agents to adaptively guide learners through complex tasks. The approach involves modeling the teaching process as a Markov Decision Process (MDP), where the teacher agent dynamically adjusts its instructional strategies based on the learner's performance and feedback. We evaluate the framework using simulated environments and real-world educational datasets, demonstrating its ability to improve learning outcomes compared to static teaching methods. Key findings reveal that the L2T framework not only accelerates skill acquisition but also enhances learner engagement and retention. This research contributes to the growing field of AI-driven education by introducing a scalable and adaptive teaching methodology with potential applications in online learning platforms, workforce training, and beyond. Keywords: artificial intelligence, reinforcement learning, intelligent tutoring systems, adaptive teaching, personalized education."}
{"text": "Understanding the structural differences between data manifolds is critical for advancing machine learning and data analysis techniques. This paper introduces *Manifold Topology Divergence* (MTD), a novel framework for quantitatively comparing the topological properties of data manifolds. The proposed approach leverages tools from algebraic topology and geometric deep learning to capture both local and global structural discrepancies between manifolds. Unlike existing methods that focus solely on geometric or statistical properties, MTD provides a unified measure that accounts for topological invariants such as connectedness, holes, and higher-dimensional structures. We evaluate the framework on synthetic and real-world datasets, demonstrating its effectiveness in identifying meaningful differences between manifolds across various domains, including image classification, natural language processing, and 3D shape analysis. Results show that MTD outperforms traditional divergence measures in capturing nuanced structural variations, offering new insights into dataset similarity and model interpretability. The framework has broad applications, including dataset comparison, transfer learning, and model evaluation, paving the way for more robust and interpretable machine learning systems.  \n\n**Keywords**: data manifolds, topology divergence, geometric deep learning, algebraic topology, machine learning interpretability, dataset comparison."}
{"text": "Few-shot learning (FSL) has emerged as a promising approach to address the challenge of training machine learning models with limited labeled data. However, a critical issue in FSL is the presence of data shift, where the distribution of training data significantly differs from that of test data, leading to degraded model performance. This paper proposes a novel framework that leverages knowledge graphs (KGs) to combat data shift in few-shot learning scenarios. By integrating structured domain knowledge from KGs, our approach enhances the model's ability to generalize across diverse and unseen data distributions. We introduce a graph-based embedding mechanism that aligns the semantic relationships between training and test samples, effectively mitigating the impact of data shift. Experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms existing FSL techniques, achieving significant improvements in accuracy and robustness. The proposed framework not only addresses the data shift problem but also provides a scalable and interpretable solution for real-world applications where labeled data is scarce. This research contributes to advancing the field of few-shot learning by bridging the gap between limited data availability and model generalization, with potential applications in domains such as healthcare, natural language processing, and computer vision.  \n\n**Keywords**: Few-shot learning, data shift, knowledge graph, graph embeddings, generalization, machine learning."}

{"text": "Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) have achieved remarkable success across various domains, but they often suffer from overfitting, especially when trained on limited datasets. This paper introduces a novel regularization technique, Stochastic Weight Matrix-based Regularization (SWMR), designed to enhance the generalization capabilities of DNNs. Unlike traditional regularization methods such as L2 or dropout, SWMR dynamically perturbs the weight matrices during training by injecting controlled stochastic noise, thereby encouraging the model to learn more robust and generalizable features. We evaluate SWMR on multiple benchmark datasets, including CIFAR-10 and ImageNet, and compare its performance against state-of-the-art regularization techniques. Experimental results demonstrate that SWMR consistently improves model accuracy and reduces overfitting, particularly in scenarios with limited training data. Furthermore, the proposed method is computationally efficient and seamlessly integrates into existing deep learning frameworks. The findings suggest that SWMR offers a promising direction for improving the robustness and generalization of DNNs, with potential applications in computer vision, natural language processing, and other AI-driven domains.  \n\n**Keywords**: Deep Neural Networks, Regularization, Stochastic Weight Matrix, Overfitting, Generalization, Robust Learning."}

{"text": "Material recognition is a critical task in computer vision, with applications ranging from robotics to augmented reality. This paper investigates the joint influence of geometry and illumination on the accuracy of material recognition systems. While previous studies have primarily focused on either geometric features or lighting conditions in isolation, our work explores their combined impact, addressing a significant gap in the field. We propose a novel framework that integrates multi-view geometry analysis with advanced illumination modeling to enhance material classification. Using a dataset of diverse materials captured under varying lighting and geometric conditions, we evaluate the performance of our approach against state-of-the-art methods. Experimental results demonstrate that considering both geometry and illumination significantly improves recognition accuracy, with our framework achieving a 12% increase in precision compared to existing techniques. The findings highlight the importance of a holistic approach to material recognition and provide valuable insights for developing more robust vision systems. This research contributes to advancing the understanding of material perception in complex environments and has potential applications in industrial automation, virtual reality, and beyond.  \n\n**Keywords**: material recognition, geometry, illumination, computer vision, multi-view analysis, lighting modeling."}
{"text": "Duplicate removal is a critical task in data management and information retrieval, particularly in large-scale datasets where redundant entries can degrade system performance and accuracy. This paper addresses the challenge of identifying and eliminating duplicates by proposing a novel approach called Sequential Context Encoding (SCE). The SCE framework leverages sequential data processing techniques to capture contextual relationships between data entries, enabling more accurate identification of duplicates even in complex and noisy datasets. The proposed method integrates a deep learning-based encoder that processes data sequences hierarchically, extracting both local and global features to enhance duplicate detection. Experimental evaluations on benchmark datasets demonstrate that SCE outperforms existing methods, achieving higher precision and recall rates while maintaining computational efficiency. The results highlight the effectiveness of sequential context modeling in improving duplicate removal tasks. This research contributes to advancing data cleaning and deduplication techniques, with potential applications in database management, data integration, and machine learning pipelines. Key innovations include the hierarchical encoding mechanism and the ability to handle diverse data types, making SCE a versatile solution for real-world scenarios.  \n\n**Keywords**: duplicate removal, sequential context encoding, data cleaning, deep learning, hierarchical feature extraction, data deduplication."}

However, the choice of loss function plays a critical role in determining the performance and generalization capabilities of these models. This paper introduces an adaptive loss function framework for super-resolution neural networks, leveraging convex optimization techniques to dynamically adjust the loss function during training. The proposed approach aims to address the limitations of fixed loss functions, which often fail to adapt to varying image characteristics and degradation patterns. By formulating the loss adaptation as a convex optimization problem, our method ensures efficient convergence and improved reconstruction accuracy. Experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate that the adaptive loss function outperforms traditional fixed loss functions, achieving superior peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) and structural similarity index (SSIM) metrics.

{"text": "Bounding box regression is a critical component in object detection tasks, yet achieving precise localization remains challenging due to the limitations of traditional loss functions such as Intersection over Union (IoU). This paper introduces Distance-IoU (DIoU) Loss, a novel loss function designed to address these limitations by incorporating both the overlap area and the normalized distance between the predicted and ground-truth bounding box centers. The proposed DIoU Loss not only accelerates convergence but also improves localization accuracy by directly minimizing the distance between bounding boxes. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets, including PASCAL VOC and MS COCO, demonstrate that DIoU Loss outperforms existing methods in terms of both speed and accuracy. Compared to IoU and Generalized IoU (GIoU), DIoU achieves faster convergence and higher precision, particularly in complex scenarios with overlapping or occluded objects. The results highlight the effectiveness of DIoU Loss in enhancing object detection frameworks, making it a valuable contribution to the field of computer vision. This work provides a robust foundation for future research in improving bounding box regression and object detection systems.  \n\n**Keywords**: Bounding box regression, Distance-IoU Loss, object detection, localization accuracy, IoU, computer vision."}

{"text": "Anomaly detection is a critical task in various domains, including cybersecurity, healthcare, and industrial systems, where identifying deviations from normal behavior is essential. This paper introduces a novel approach for anomaly detection using prototype-guided discriminative latent embeddings. The proposed method leverages a deep learning framework to learn compact and discriminative representations of normal data, guided by prototype samples that encapsulate the core characteristics of the normal class. By contrasting these prototypes with potential anomalies, the model effectively identifies outliers with high precision. The approach incorporates a joint optimization strategy that simultaneously minimizes intra-class variance and maximizes inter-class separation in the latent space, enhancing the discriminative power of the embeddings. Experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art anomaly detection techniques in terms of accuracy and robustness. The framework is particularly effective in scenarios with imbalanced data distributions and limited labeled anomalies. This research contributes to the field by providing a scalable and interpretable solution for anomaly detection, with potential applications in real-time monitoring systems and predictive maintenance.  \n\n**Keywords**: anomaly detection, deep learning, latent embeddings, prototype guidance, discriminative learning, outlier detection."}
{"text": "Medical image classification is a critical task in healthcare, but its effectiveness is often hindered by the limited availability of large, annotated datasets. This paper addresses the challenge of improving the generalization of medical image classifiers when trained on small datasets. We propose a novel reinforcement-based approach that enhances model robustness by leveraging transfer learning and adaptive data augmentation techniques. Our method integrates a reinforcement learning framework to dynamically optimize augmentation strategies, ensuring the model learns invariant features across diverse medical imaging scenarios. Experiments were conducted on publicly available medical imaging datasets, including chest X-rays and skin lesion images, to evaluate the proposed approach. Results demonstrate significant improvements in classification accuracy and generalization compared to traditional methods, achieving state-of-the-art performance on small datasets. The proposed framework not only reduces overfitting but also enhances the model's ability to adapt to unseen data, making it a promising solution for real-world medical applications where data scarcity is a common issue. This research contributes to advancing medical image analysis by providing a scalable and efficient approach for training robust classifiers with limited data.  \n\n**Keywords**: medical image classification, small datasets, reinforcement learning, data augmentation, transfer learning, generalization."}
{"text": "Instance segmentation, a critical task in computer vision, aims to delineate individual objects within an image while assigning unique labels to each instance. Traditional approaches often rely on predefined heuristics or post-processing steps to separate instances, which can limit accuracy and scalability. This paper introduces a novel framework that incorporates the number of clusters directly into the embedding learning process, enabling the model to dynamically adapt to varying object densities and complex scenes. Our approach leverages a modified embedding space where the number of clusters is explicitly encoded, allowing for more precise instance separation without additional post-processing. We evaluate the proposed method on benchmark datasets, including COCO and Cityscapes, and demonstrate significant improvements in segmentation accuracy and robustness compared to state-of-the-art methods. The results highlight the effectiveness of integrating cluster count information into the learning pipeline, offering a scalable solution for real-world applications such as autonomous driving, medical imaging, and robotics.

{"text": "This paper addresses the challenge of view extrapolation of the human body from a single image, a task critical for applications in virtual reality, animation, and 3D modeling. The objective is to generate realistic and consistent multi-view representations of a human body using only a single 2D input image. To achieve this, we propose a novel deep learning-based framework that leverages a combination of generative adversarial networks (GANs) and 3D geometric priors. Our approach integrates a multi-stage pipeline, including pose estimation, depth prediction, and texture synthesis, to ensure accurate spatial and visual consistency across extrapolated views. Experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms existing techniques in terms of visual fidelity and geometric accuracy, achieving state-of-the-art performance on benchmark datasets. The proposed framework also shows robustness to variations in pose, lighting, and clothing, making it suitable for real-world applications. This research contributes a scalable and efficient solution for single-image view extrapolation, with potential implications for immersive technologies and digital content creation.  \n\n**Keywords**: view extrapolation, human body reconstruction, single-image 3D modeling, generative adversarial networks (GANs), virtual reality, pose estimation."}

The objective of this research is to address the challenge of learning meaningful spatiotemporal features from unlabeled video data, which is critical for tasks such as action recognition and video understanding. The proposed CEP framework employs a cycle-consistent encoding mechanism that predicts future frame representations based on past frames and reconstructs past representations from future ones, ensuring robust temporal feature learning. By integrating contrastive learning, the model maximizes the similarity between positive pairs (temporally related frames) while minimizing it for negative pairs, further improving feature discriminability. Experiments conducted on benchmark video datasets demonstrate that CEP outperforms existing self-supervised methods in downstream tasks, achieving state-of-the-art performance in action recognition and video retrieval. The results highlight the effectiveness of the cycle encoding approach in capturing long-term temporal dependencies and improving generalization.

This paper introduces a novel approach to address this problem by leveraging multi-scale deep neural networks with learned down-scaling kernels. The proposed method focuses on enhancing the quality of deblurring by incorporating adaptive down-scaling mechanisms that preserve essential image details while reducing computational complexity. Unlike traditional fixed-kernel down-scaling methods, our approach learns optimal kernels during training, enabling the network to better handle non-uniform blur patterns across different scales.  \n\nThe architecture integrates a multi-scale framework with attention mechanisms to prioritize regions affected by varying blur intensities. Experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate significant improvements in both quantitative metrics (e.g., PSNR and SSIM) and visual quality compared to state-of-the-art methods. The learned down-scaling kernels contribute to more accurate blur estimation and reconstruction, particularly in complex scenarios with motion blur and defocus.  \n\nThis work advances the field of image deblurring by introducing a scalable and efficient solution that adapts to non-uniform blur characteristics.

{"text": "This paper addresses the challenge of estimating mutual information (MI) in high-dimensional and complex data distributions, a critical task in information theory and machine learning. Traditional MI estimation methods often struggle with scalability, accuracy, and computational efficiency, particularly in scenarios involving non-linear dependencies. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel approach based on inductive mutual information estimation using a convex maximum-entropy copula framework. Our method leverages the principles of maximum entropy to model dependencies between variables while ensuring computational tractability and robustness. By formulating the problem as a convex optimization task, we achieve efficient estimation even for high-dimensional data. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach outperforms existing methods in terms of accuracy and scalability across various synthetic and real-world datasets. Furthermore, the proposed framework provides a principled way to handle non-linear relationships and offers insights into the underlying dependency structures. This work contributes to advancing mutual information estimation techniques, with potential applications in feature selection, dependency analysis, and machine learning model interpretability.  \n\n**Keywords**: mutual information, maximum entropy, copula, convex optimization, dependency modeling, high-dimensional data."}

Despite significant advancements in deep learning-based approaches, these models remain vulnerable to adversarial attacks, which can severely degrade their performance. This paper investigates the robustness of state-of-the-art deep networks for monocular depth estimation under adversarial conditions. We analyze the impact of targeted and untargeted adversarial attacks on popular architectures, such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and transformer-based models, highlighting their susceptibility to perturbations in input data. To address these vulnerabilities, we propose a novel defense mechanism that integrates adversarial training with a gradient masking technique, effectively reducing the model\u2019s sensitivity to adversarial inputs. Experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate that our proposed method significantly improves robustness while maintaining high accuracy in depth estimation tasks. The findings underscore the importance of developing secure and reliable depth estimation systems, particularly for safety-critical applications.

{"text": "This paper introduces Reset-Free Guided Policy Search (RF-GPS), a novel approach to deep reinforcement learning (RL) that addresses the challenge of training policies in environments with stochastic initial states without requiring frequent resets. Traditional RL methods often rely on resetting the environment to predefined states, which can be impractical in real-world applications where such control is unavailable. RF-GPS leverages a guided search mechanism to efficiently explore the state space and adapt to varying initial conditions, enabling robust policy learning in dynamic and uncertain environments. The proposed method combines model-based planning with policy optimization, utilizing a probabilistic model to predict state transitions and guide exploration. Experimental results demonstrate that RF-GPS significantly reduces training time and improves sample efficiency compared to existing RL algorithms, achieving superior performance across multiple benchmark tasks with stochastic initializations. The approach also exhibits strong generalization capabilities, making it suitable for real-world applications such as robotics and autonomous systems. This work contributes to advancing RL methodologies by eliminating the need for environment resets, thereby enhancing the practicality and scalability of RL in complex, real-world scenarios.  \n\n**Keywords**: deep reinforcement learning, stochastic initial states, reset-free learning, guided policy search, model-based RL, robotics, autonomous systems."}
{"text": "Discrete graphical models are powerful tools for representing complex dependencies among variables in high-dimensional data. However, accurately estimating their underlying structure remains a significant challenge. This paper addresses the problem of structure estimation for discrete graphical models by leveraging generalized covariance matrices and their inverses. We propose a novel approach that extends traditional covariance-based methods to discrete domains, enabling efficient and scalable structure recovery. Our method employs a combination of statistical techniques and optimization algorithms to estimate the inverse of generalized covariance matrices, which encode conditional independence relationships among variables. Experimental results on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that our approach outperforms existing methods in terms of accuracy and computational efficiency, particularly in high-dimensional settings. The proposed framework not only provides a robust solution for structure estimation but also offers insights into the theoretical connections between covariance matrices and graphical models. This work contributes to advancing the field of probabilistic graphical models and has potential applications in areas such as bioinformatics, social network analysis, and machine learning.  \n\n**Keywords**: discrete graphical models, structure estimation, generalized covariance matrices, inverse covariance, high-dimensional data, conditional independence."}
{"text": "This paper addresses the challenge of normalizing activations in deep neural networks, particularly in scenarios where batch normalization (BN) struggles, such as small batch sizes or non-i.i.d. data distributions. We propose Group Normalization (GN), a novel normalization technique that divides channels into groups and computes mean and variance within each group for normalization. Unlike BN, GN is independent of batch size, making it robust and versatile across various tasks, including object detection, segmentation, and video analysis. Our experiments demonstrate that GN achieves competitive performance compared to BN on large-scale image classification tasks and outperforms BN in tasks with limited batch sizes or dynamic input resolutions. The results highlight GN's effectiveness in improving model stability and generalization, particularly in complex real-world applications. This work contributes a simple yet powerful normalization method that bridges the gap between batch-dependent and batch-independent approaches, offering a practical solution for modern deep learning architectures.  \n\n**Keywords**: Group Normalization, deep learning, neural networks, batch normalization, activation normalization, object detection, segmentation."}
