{"text": "It is undoubtedly the case that the world has become a global village nowadays. Cooperations between different countries exist almost on every occasion. As a result, there are inevitably large amounts of information that are exchanged and shared for various usages. However, access to information has remained to be one of the most debatable issues. Some people believe that information should be shared without restriction, while others insist that the foremost information shouldn’t be exchanged for free. In my view, appropriate measures or costs can be taken to protect valuable information from being abused or stolen. It is fairly easy to understand the view of people who are in favor of exchanging information as much as possible. To improve the quality of research or guarantee the success of cooperation, it is usually necessary to share resources and exchange minds with each other. Furthermore, the amount of shared information is often decisive to the time and result, which sometimes might be eagerly expected. For example, it is almost unimaginable that the vaccine of covid 19 was so quickly created without intensive international cooperation, which contains an enormous sum of shared knowledge and experience in the diverse field, from governments to universities. With the benefit of this sharing, the period of the vaccine, which can take more than ten years in the past, was immensely shortened this time and the quality of the vaccine is also prestigious over the world. Nevertheless, the over-sharing of information could also be harmful and risky. There is every possibility that information of importance and value can be misused and eventually leads to severe problems if the intention of usage can’t be proven as legal and righteous or the risk of information leakage exists through sharing. For example, if classified military information is hacked by terrorists while the governments of two countries are sharing and discussing their military intelligence, it will result in a horrible disaster that treats all the citizens. Therefore, it is necessary to take measures to protect the safety of sensitive information from unauthorized access. To sum up, sharing information is certainly helpful and meaningful in improving a wide variety of cooperation. However, it is also urgent to pay attention to the sharing of sensitive information in order to guarantee its safety."}
{"text": "The role of colors in our psycological life is crucial. Some people suggest hence to pay attention on color schemes when workplaces or hospital are decorated. I agree that colors affect people's psychological health. A particular place's decoration can arouse a determinate feeling that could favour or penalise the capacity of people in a work place. Colors affect our psycological life. They possess an extraordinary social role. It is not a case that the famous table of emotions is presented in different colors where the different colors represent different emotions. For instance, blue incline people to be sad while red is said to be the color of passion, and move strongly the emotions of a person by setting of her pleasures. Lastly the grey's shades stimulate anxiety. Therefore, I think that the hospital's walls or officies cannot be decorated in grey or blue as long as it is better to stimulate their positiveness and productivity. Thre is a curious story about Princess Sissi, that confirm the impact of color in our life. She was obsessed about her wight and fitness. For this reason, she decored purple all the walls of her appartmanets. Indeed, pourple is said to be the color which stimulates the absence of hunger. Thus, when the princess was there it was easier for her to be fast. By contrast, there are also some colors that stimulate fantasy, creativity and peace. Green is one of that color. Then, to decorate hospitals with green shades could be a good way to produce positive vibes in people who are sicks. Moreover, yellow is defined as the color that describes the feeling of being proud, aware and confident. Then, using this color in the walls of the officies will stimulate workers to do their better. Their capacity in the work-place will be maximased by the general environment. In conclusion, I believe that colors affect our psychological life and then people should pay attention in the feelings they stimulate when they decore a room or a building intented to welcome a particular type of people like sicks people or workers. Psychological life is important and relevant as the physical one and colors can affects our moods as well as physical accidents do."}

What are the difficulties while living in large cities then?Firstly, it is the lack of jobs and occupations due to the fierce competitiveness between thousands of applicants.Moreover,because of high number of employees,regularly will companies raise their standards making it painfully challenging to get a job .For instance,to be hired as an accountant,not only do you need flawless techinque skills but also flexibility and adaptiveness to satisfy the company's demand and surpass other applicants.Secondly,the increasing population density can be a potential security endangerment as the rate of criminals and lawbreakers is significantly higher than places with fewer residents.Furthermore,tracking down criminals will more challenging because of the widespread radius of populated areas.For example,chasing down a theif in a countryside would be far more easier than a city because there are less space to hide and shelter for the theifs. Hence, the government should encourage people to move to outlying areas.At first glance,it fixes the issue of jobs and occupation as civilians are now fairly distributed to other regions, creating a less stressing and competitive working environment.As a matter of fact,the rate of poverty and famine will be reduced as the income for most famlies become higher thanks to more job opportunities.In addition,by having scatterd citizen equally,we can ensure the safety of our people by managing the crime rate of each region.In fact,this will prevent crime concentration in one area but scatter them in many places,making it more convenient to protect civilians. In conclusion,living in large cities can have multiple drawbacks,especially job opportunity and security therefore motivating citizen relocate to urban areas should be considered as soon as possible for the reasons above."}
{"text": "Some people claim that it is acceptable to use animals in medical research for the benefit of human beings, while others argue that it is wrong. Discuss both views and give your opinion.People have different views on how medical research should be conducted and tested. Although many people support the use of for developing medicines, I personally believe that animal testing is morally wrong.The main reason why some people value to conduct medical research is because animal testing has contributed to many life-saving cures and treatments. It is true that nearly every medical breakthrough in the last 100 years has resulted directly from research using animals. For example, experiments in which dogs had their pancreases removed led directly to the discovery of insulin, critical to saving the lives of diabetics. Furthermore, it is impossible to release to the market before proving it no harm to humans and laboratory mice are appropriate research subjects because they are similar to human beings in many ways.However, I people who consider medical development that involved the use of animals cruel and unacceptable. I believe that the lives of all creatures should be respected and we, humans, have no right to for our own benefits. Governments should invest in developing alternative methods that can replace when doing medical research. For example, a software program can be developed to model a human immune system and new drugs can be tested on the software rather than animals. In this way, no animals will suffer from the medical tests and the society can still benefit from medical development.In conclusion, although it is undoubtedly true that animal testing has helped scientists in drug developments and medical discoveries, I believe that the benefits to humans do not justify the suffering caused to animals and we should use alternative methods when doing medical research that do not involve animals suffering."}
{"text": "Nowadays people waste a lot of food that was bought from shops and restaurants. In this essay, the reason for wasting food and the acts which can be done by humans to reduce the amount of food one throws away will be thorougly discussed. Firstly, people waste food as one tends to be satisfied with the amount one eats. Thus, people order food more than one can eat as one can not estimate the amount of food. The amount of food one person can consume differs on one's conditions at that moment. The conditions include mood, physical features and activities one did on that particular day. Furthermore, one wants to taste all sorts of food, however, one can not eat all of those. Sometimes, people order food which are well decorated just to take a photo of it and upload it on social media such as Instagram. After taking photo, people just leave the food. The above mentioned reasons can be the causes of wastage of food. Apparently, people can reduce the amount of food they throw away. The restaurants can provide more informations about the amount and taste briefly to avoid the situation that consumers can not finish the food and are dissatisfied with the taste or smell. Moreover, consumers have to make a wise decision so that they do not waste both food and money. People should co-operate to reduce the wastage of food as it causes pollution on land. It leads to bad smell and brings insects to the areas. Conclusively, it is quite clear that people greatly waste food and there are a few ways for people to follow so as to reduce the amount of waste food."}
{"text": "Nowadays, the younger generation tends to avoid recreational activities such as hiking or alpinism. It seems that young people prefer to spend their weekends indoors, gaming or engaging in other online activities. If that is the case, by promoting sports more actively and organising sports competitions, the schools could counteract this trend.Living in the era of technology, the wide availability and variety of online entertainment are compelling young people to spend a lot of their free time indoors, using their gadgets. Numerous relatively cheap forms of amusement, such as online games, videos, audiobooks and plenty of other activities, tempt teenagers to stay at home and lead more sedentary lifestyles. A recent survey revealed that the vast majority of students would prefer spending their weekends playing computer games, rather than in the nature. That is one clear reason why our modern youth is less interested in recreational sports.To address this issue, the school management could intervene and offer a better range of outdoor sports activities and competitions, both within the school curriculum and as extra-curricular activities. For example, high schools could increase the number of weekly football, running and climbing classes, and organise competitions at the end of each term. As a result, pushed by their desire to win, students would do more walking, jogging, running and mountaineering during the school term, in preparation for the competition. This would reduce the time spent online, lessen the students’ dependence on the Internet for entertainment, and eventually boost their desire to spend more time enjoying the natural environment.To sum up, screen addiction plays a major role in young people’s avoidance of various outdoor activities. Opening up more recreational sports and offering frequent competitions on school grounds is a great way to motivate more students to spend their leisure time in the nature."}
{"text": "As we all know, recruitment is a continuous process that has been evolving over the past years. Nowadays, selection of qualified applicants is a tedious job which involves a considerable amount of time and effort. It has been stated that wealthy countries must allow experienced and intelligent employees from impoverished countries to secure a job in an affluent nation. I completely agree with this statement. In this essay, reasons and examples will be discussed further. Recruitment mainly involves identification of potential applicants, screening, interviewing and hiring candidates for a particular organization. It may seem a daunting task for those working in human resources. With the advent of technology, the process is simplified, faster and more convenient. Mostly, email is used for applying and sending the credentials abroad, chances of getting hired is often possible. For instance, many immigrants from Asia, which belongs to developing countries are able to successfully obtain an employment in North America with the help of social media platforms. Also, with their valuable experience and rewarding career in the past, they were able to practice their profession in newly industralized countries. It is beneficial for them to accept skilled workers from economically poor countries to fill in the vacancies in labor market. For instance, a highly respected nurse who earned her bachelor's degree back home decided to work overseas as a healthcare aide eventhough she's overqualified for the position while waiting for her credential evaluation and license. This scenario depicts that rich countries benefit and utilize this person's ability to contribute significantly in the economy. In addition, job recruitment is advantageous for the country since talents and skills of the people from developing countries has been internationally recognized, thereby giving a sense of pride and honor. Moreover, hiring of people overseas should be a fair procedure that takes into consideration the most indispensable requirement which is skills and knowledge, not merely based on the worker's country of origin. However, there are also drawbacks associated from recruitment of foreign workers which include increasing costs, loss of cultural ties and conflict of interest. From my perspective, I am in favor of hiring people from third world countries since majority of these people has the expertise, achievements and excellent communication skills which are desirable attributes of an employee. With enough manpower, it will address the staffing crisis and labor shortage in rich countries."}
{"text": "International sporting events are well-known for attracting a high level of attention because they give many people something to look forward to. Understandably, there are advantages and disadvantages for the host country, and careful consideration is required to determine whether a nation will benefit or lose from hosting a major sports championship.Worryingly, the new infrastructure required for hosting a major sporting event often comes at the expense of local people. Their lives get disrupted by construction works and at times residents have even been evicted from their homes for stadiums to be built. Worse still, practice shows the expensive, gigantic buildings constructed for the sports event aren’t being used afterwards and fall into disrepair, leaving the country with high maintenance bills. The financial burden from hosting the Olympic Games, for example, is staggering and can run into tens of billions. Still, the question remains whether or not the pros outnumber the cons.It is hard to underestimate the amount of influence on the country’s global status and prestige that comes with becoming a home to an international sporting event. New trade opportunities appear on the horizon, as it happened for many countries that hosted the Olympic Games. There is also a welcome increase in tourism, which gives the local economy a boost, injecting billions of dollars into the national budget. Construction of new stadiums, hotels and infrastructure such as new roads and rail links creates new jobs, further improving the country’s economy. Less tangible but still important is the aspect of national pride and the feel-good factor associated with hosting an international sports event.All in all, it seems to me that an international sporting event can bring more good than harm to a country, especially if its potential dangers can be avoided or minimised. Hosting a World Championship is a one-in-a-lifetime opportunity for a country and an immense source of pride for its citizens."}
{"text": "It is indeed true that digital resources today far outstrip what can be put and stored in print books. Almost any kind of book can now be accessed digitally and those that can’t be will soon be changed to a digital format. Some people, therefore, believe that libraries with print books are no longer needed.If one looks at this issue dispassionately, it seems far more logical that people now should only read books digitally. It only requires a single computer or electronic reader and an individual can have access to the history of literature and works on all other fields. The costs involved with setting, typing, printing and distributing print books would practically disappear and this would make things more convenient and much cheaper. An actual library building would be totally unnecessary, as all one would need would be a ‘virtual library’ as a website and all works could be accessed through this portal. There would not even be any need to leave the house to gain access to anything one needed. This would seem to be the most logical way of proceeding.Logic, however, is not always the best approach to everything. Print books have a long history with humanity and our relationship with real books is not something that can be changed overnight. Many people, including younger readers, feel that there is something special about having a book with real paper and needing to turn pages. There will therefore for the time being be a future for print books and libraries.Libraries will continue to be especially important, as not all older people use computers and e-readers as much as the younger generation. They will still want to read print books and the library is a cheap and convenient place to find them. In addition, if only a few books in print are available in the future, libraries might be one of the few places where they might be accessed. Another purpose that libraries serve is acting as community centres that organise events, education and childcare. Ironically, libraries also provide computers and Internet access for people who cannot afford their own.In spite of the seeming dominance to come of digital books, I feel that there is and will be a place for libraries with print books. This state of affairs might change in the future, but at present, they are important community resources."}
{"text": "Nowadays, trading businesses are made throughout the world resulting from the increased globalization. Consequently, employees are requested to have a variety of knowledge in their jobs due to remain a highly competitive capabilities in labour markets over the world. Parents have much struggles on the arrangement regarding additional classes out of school to their children in order to gain the competitive advantages in their future career. This eassy attempts to find out the main considerations on this. There is no doubt that school curriculum largely focuses on academic studies, including physical, Maths and organic chemistry etc., Those subjects are designed to connect with learning in a higher education. It is reasonable to say that this curriculum may not enable the teenagers to gain various knowledeges aspects of digital world and our planet. Learning in extra classes out of syllabus is an opportunity for them to really discover what they may be passionate about and in turn, help them develop new skills that may come in handy for a future occupation that is related. On the other hand, it is not difficult to notice a lot of parents forcing their children into learning something that does not interest them. Sometimes, the intensive courses are arranged by parents to their children study at the weekends. As a result, it could lead to undesired results or even negative impacts on the parent-child relationship, so maybe it's best for children to figure it out on their own sometimes. My take on this is that younsters are extremely inquisitive and energetic, consequently, it's really the prime time of their life to explore and learn new things. Studying in classes outside the syllabus are good intention, but children are forced to learn what their parents love to only. This not only ruins the parent-child relationship but also may results in children's resistance to learning."}
{"text": "It is considered by many nowadays that sports has become a lucrative industry for the sports personals and companies bidding on teams and sports people . Though, there are positive's and negative's considering how humongous the money making business around sports has evolved , the postives outweighs the negatives, which is also my opinion. Firstly, over the years number of people involving directly by playing a sport or indirectly by watching it has increased . This creates pressure in sports personal and the management to provide quality sports which itself is costly considering the prices of telecasting and the technological advances. Secondly, giving the sports personal proper financial aid ,boosts their performance ,as most of the athletes come from a humble background . Providing financial aid also helps them to buy quality sports gear . Thirdly , most people drop their ambition of taking sports due to poor payments than other sectors , so giving them salaries is quite hard for the sports management if there are no sponsors . The business around sports has been everblooming, be it in the form of owning, sponsoring or betting. The companies, involve in sports industry with a motive of advertising their brands on large scale ,which otherwise ,is an unachievable task . The betting industry has been rising ,as it is highly lucrative considering the time and resources spent . On the other hand , people also believed that too much of flow of money has created corruption in the sports sector . The example of DLF IPL scam by Lalit Modi supports the argument of such people , commonwealth scam is also one such. The people in betting are luring players with money and fixing matches for their monetary gains which is killing the spirit of the game. In conclusion, I support that high earnings in sports industry has had a positive impact on the quality of sports played and also being delivered on televisions with such quality."}
{"text": "Thanks to the techonoligical development it is now possible to do things that our grandparents considered impossible. Now it is posible for scientists and turinsts to go in places remote as the South Pole. This possibility have a double face. Some people believe that it positive to have the opportunity to know and visit places we could just imagined until few years ago. On the other hand, others believe we are the resposible for the distruction of certain natural environment. I believe the disadvantages could exceed the advantages. Nowadays, thanks to the techonolical development, we have the great possibility to go anywhere and visit extraordinary places like the South Pole. We can see how the animals live, how it is possible to survive under certain climatic conditions. Furthermore, we can develop more accurate analysis and researches. From the scientific point of you the possibility to go in remote places is surely a crucial chance of discover and lerning something about our planet. Certain places in the last years are also becoming open to the turism. This involve that have been organised ways of transortation as well as hotel have been opened. While, one should see these as advantages concerning the economical status of these isolated places, I belive it is the starting point of the destractuction of the natural environment. Although the workers of turistm sector claim to pay attention in preserving the natural status of places like the South Pole, it is impossibile to believe in them. Indeed, to welcome people and technological instruments is already a way in which a natural enviroment is stressed and ruined. In particular, techonological advices produce radiations, which toghether with chimical and electrical stimuli could afftect the ground of a place like the South Pole. For instance, radiations and electrical stimulations can make the temperature higher and this could be a cause of the environment's ruination. Furthermore, animals who live in the South Pole can be negatively influenced by the turists. Indeed, they are not social animals who have grown up together with human beings. They could get sick because of the noisy sounds produced by humans and by their techonolical advices. In conclusion, I believe that although we can aquire knowledge thanks to the possibility of visiting places like South Pole, our presence is distrupting the environment and could be one of the casuse of some animal species' extinction."}
{"text": "Some people think it is better for children to grown up in the city, while others think that life in the countryside is more suitable for them. What are the advantages and disadvantages of both places?Living in the rural area is the best option for children by a group of people, while others believe that cities offer more opportunities. In my opinion, if the city offers security and green areas, I agree it is a better place to raise the next generation some advantages both sides.Firstly, the countryside in touch with nature, taking care of animals and helping with the gardening. Because of that, they learn how to protect the environment and to live without any technological equipment. Besides that, they have more freedom to play outside the house without any security worries, whereas in the city they are kept at home smartphones and computers for this reason. On the other hand, schools usually have lower quality and it is hard to find extracurricular classes. Therefore, children difficulties trying to develop their abilities besides the school curriculum.However, schools at metropolitan areas tend to have better quality and offer all kinds of activities. Even if there is a sport or an art course that the institution does not offer, it is possible to look for it in another place around the city. As a result, all children’s talents and passions can be easier to develop. On the other hand, security, pollution and contact with nature are issues that we have to worry about. The better option would be a city with an excellent quality of life where children could play in parks and gardens.To sum up, growing up in the countryside can be very positive for someone’s childhood, but the city will usually offer better opportunities for their talents’ development."}
{"text": "Over the centuries, young people have always been following the path of the older generation, learning from them to one day become, once adult, the one leading the youngest. But it seems that it is changing in our modern world, young people now really have their word to say, are being heard and are influencing the whole society. Internet and generalised use of social media has had a huge impact on how people communicate, especially for the young generation. While our generation grew up without acces to internet, asking for informations to our parents, teachers... young people have access to all kind of knowledge and datas on the web. They can forge their own opinions easily and expose their ideas to the entire world throught internet. Then they can share these ideas and discuss with people from everywhere in the community or in the world , their point of view are taken into account because their voices are being heard widely through internet. Multinationals and marketing companies well understood that the young generation is the one giving the trend. They use all the data collected from the social networks to target the product that the youngest one are going to plebiscit. This underlines the fact that the taste and ideas of the young people are powerful and really are influencing the whole society in a large spectrum. Sometimes, this is hard to accept for the oldest one who have been raised with a very diferent approach. In many countries, for a very long time, the oldest people, known as the one with the knowledge, were the one deciding, taking the decisions and showing the way. They were representing the authority and the power that very often young people would follow without questionning about the fact that things evolve and could be done in a very diferent way. However, we can learn a lot from the young generations. As they were born in world changing faster and faster they often are more resilient than we are and they probably fit better in that new modern world where adaptibility is a key to success. It makes them extremely powerful and influent, wether it is at work or at home."}
{"text": "Nowadays, in our competitive world, to succeed, knowledge from school and university is not enough. Therefore, students who study from the school to university get fewer benefits and contribute less too, compared to those who travel or work and get experience and skills . There are two following reasons to support for my opinion. I refer to the group of people who study from school to university as ‘group A’ and the other group – as ‘group B’.Firstly, at school and university, what group A gains is almost entirely theory, theory and theory. Of course, theory is very , however, you can’t do everything with just theory. You must have experience. This is what group A . Although in the third or fourth year at university, group A can be apprentices in some companies, to help them approach their future jobs, they aren’t trained well because of the short time spent working. And the real job is still very strange to them. After graduating, without experience, group A students can’t accomplish their work perfectly. On the other hand, it takes them time and money to keep up with other experienced students and they may be scorned. Therefore, group A students can contribute less than group B who have the two most important things: skills and experience.Secondly, as group A students are contributing less, they surely get less benefit. Moreover, many companies which employ people in group A have to train them from ground-up. These companies take this cost from group A’s salary to reduce the risk of their employees leaving to other companies after being trained. So, less benefits are unavoidable and certain, group B members are more loyal and effective workers. They also have useful experience and skills. Besides, their education is the same as or even higher than that of group A. As the result, group B gets more benefits absolutely.In conclusion, I think a student should travel or work before going to the university. That way, not only will they have basic knowledge but also skills and experience which are useful for them to get a good job and have a brilliant future."}
{"text": "The globalised world these days makes it simpler than ever before for people to relocate and start building a life in a new country. As everyone comes from their own cultural background, a question arises of whether or not people should be expected to follow the customs of their host country. I completely agree with the view that while learning about the local customs may require some time and effort, it is valuable and will aid the integration of the newcomers into society.In many cultures following the local customs means showing respect, which is an important moral value in nearly every culture. The opposite is also true: disregarding traditions is often seen as a sign of disrespect. In order to establish good neighbourly relationships and feel welcome in the new place, it is important to demonstrate the effort to become part of the community. By expressing an interest in learning traditions, new arrivals gain a chance to interact with their neighbours and colleagues, get to know them and build some connections in the new country.Another positive aspect is the enhanced feeling of belonging that people get from participating in activities others around them are doing. When a national festival is in full swing, standing on the sidelines might make people feel excluded and perhaps even homesick, whereas joining others opens up opportunities to attend special events together, go to parties, meet new people and feel part of the celebrations. In Australia, for example, Easter is a very special time of the year and some of the traditional activities include Easter egg decoration and gifting, and baking hot cross buns; sharing your designs and recipes with others is an excellent conversation starter.In conclusion, learning the customs and traditions of one’s new country doesn’t mean a loss of their own culture. On the contrary, it is an opportunity to gain a deeper understanding of cultural connections and should be embraced as a positive experience."}
{"text": "Whether parents should fully intervene in their children's organization of their leisure time or let them decide it, remains a big discussion. In this essay I will contrast the two opinions and I will explain why I think a good balance is needed. One of the reasons supporting the first view is the idea of the undeveloped children's ability to organize. This is because, although some of them might seem very mature for their age, others might struggle understanding the importance of having a routine, besides playing video games. For instance, many parents orientate their children helping them to organize hobbies and teaching a very important skill, time managment. On the other hand, some people encourage children to decide themselves what to do as this stimulates creativity and personal growth. This view, therefore, opens a new world for the little ones who can decide whatever they like, having multiple options. For example, children in this situation quite often are supported when they want to play sports or participate in a painting class. In my opinion, parents should not only be envolved as much as they can in all aspects of their children's lives, but also they might encourage the little ones to have personal opinions and decision about their hobbies and leisure actitivities. This may be a good way to build trust and communication between parents and children. Moreover, children learn responsability while being guided by their parents. In conclusion, some parents help their children more in scheduling their free time, while others intervene less leaving them to create a routine freely. I believe, parents should always be involved in their children's lives and decisions, allowing children participation too, which brings multiple benefits to their relationship."}
{"text": "It is supposed by many, that high-cost space studies should be cut off while more focus should be paid to the challenges mankind face on Earth. This essay completely disargees with such view because of two reasons that will de developed further. The first reason is that only rich countries spend thier budgets for space studies. This means that only when states have resolved most of their problems with poverty, level of medicine treatment, safety, they can divert some of the funds to invest in future technologies. Moreover, citizens will go on a strike and make the govenment to deal with real life problems instead of dreaming about the space. For example, not more than 5% of USA GDP is spent on space programs that is sufficient to progress, construct new sputniks, and send astronauts to the Internations Space Station. The second argument supposes that many space technologies have a dual puropose. In other words, being initially developed for studing the space, they were adopted to make people's day-to-day life easier. For example, mobile phones and the mobile Internet, navigaion using GPS would not be possibe if people were not trying to explore space. In conclusion, new technologies are developed when people are trying to learn the world outside our planet."}
{"text": "Nowardays, it widely believed that most people have forgotten the main purpose of some traditions and religious celebrations, but during those festival periods they just prefer to enjoy themselves and have a fun from holiday. In this essay, I will discuss two opposite attitudes of modern people to some traditional celebrations and give example and some advice to the issue. On the one hand, it seems that the majority of people does not care about the reason of holidays, they are ready to enjoy them without any concrete reasons. First of all, that happens usually because of the fact that many people overwork and do not live in their work-life balance, so they are very glad to have additional day-off. The second explanation to the issue can be that people follow some traditions from ancient times, so some of those traditions became as a routines, that the basic meaning could be forgotten during the times. But nations continue folloving some customs just because they got used to them, even if they do not remember the main purpose of the celebration. The third reason to that can be that young generation do not understand some of their ancestors traditions, so they just accept some festivals from their predecessors as days when they are able to make their lives brighter and enjoy themselves. On the other hand, there are exist people who know the basics of festivals and familiar with the hystory of traditions in their countries. Such kind of people usually consern about their traditions and pay more attantions to some specific atributes of festivals, which can be symbolise health, wealth, success, or maybe femily hapiness, et cetera. In my opinion, it would be beneficial if the main purposes of some, especially ancient, traditions, to be explained to others. First of all, people would become familiar with some old customs and maybe partly could understand the reasons why their ancestors used some kind of colors and accesuars during that holidays. Additionally, people would know better the histories of their countries and share those knowledge with younger generations. So, the youth could not only enjoy themselves during celebrations, but also become more intelligent about traditions in their homelands. To sum it up, it is widely spread attitude on holiday organisation as to only having entertainment, dancing, and having wonderful moods during those days. However, if the history of festivals and ancient traditions is spread properly, people become more wisdom about the main reasons of those celebrations in their countries."}
{"text": "Recently, many countries have legalized gay marriage. However, there are many people who do not agree with that, and claim that it has a bad influence on the education of children, and the evolution of society. However, in my opinion, I think it is a good opportunity for homosexual people as they are now understood by others, and have the right to have children despite of their situation. To begin, there are many parents, for example, who tend to believe that because of the access to gay marriage, their children will find it normal to fall in love with a person from the same sex. As a result, more and more children will become homosexual, which is unconventional as far as the parents are concerned. However, I believe that it is not because children understand the fact that being gay is normal, that they will be influenced by this. In fact, they will be able to compassionate for people who struggle to express their homosexuality, so they will help them to feel more comfortable with that. Moreover, they will be more open-minded which is very important for children development. Secondly, many other people are convinced that gay marriage will inevitably tends towards a decrease of the young population as gay individuals can not have their own kids. As a consequence, This phenomenon represents a threat because young people will not be able to take over for the future. However, I am not of this opinion. I think that such a decrease in young people population will not occur as the vast majority of the world's population in not homosexual. Moreover, by allowing gay marriage, gay couples will be able to adopt children. Indeed, due to the fact that they are not able to give rise to new-born, they can adopt children who are abandonned, and give them the opportunity to live in a new family with good conditions. To conclude, I firmly believe that gay marriage is a good opportunity for the development of the society. Indeed, not only it makes children more open-minded, which is important for their own development, but also gives for those who are unfortunately abandonned, a safe environment to thrive in."}
{"text": "That of trasportation is a question that have troubled all the people over the world, whatever it is the city or town in which they live. In the last years people used to relying on the private car to move around. . Although the possible reasons that persuaded people to use private cars, the problems that rise from their excessive use, such us traffic and pollution, are harsh consequences to be accepted. I think that an improvement of public trasportation and to incentive the use of ecological means of trasport like bicycle should be possible solution to those issues. Cars are considered the most confortable mean of trasport. In particular, if you have to move in a big cities like Milan. Indeed, means of trasports sometimes are late or full and also more unsafe. If you are a woman, for example, the use of public trasportation in some part of Italy is not safe mostly during the night hours. Another problem is that of comfort. If people use their car they can go whethever they want, when they want. If they have to spend more time in a place, they have not to be worried about the last bus they had to take to come back home. However, over-reliance of cars cause at least two big problmes: traffic and pollution. On the one hand, the problem of traffic will produce other issues such as anxiety and irritation. Indeed, if you have to go work in the morning and you live in a city like Rome you have to consider at least one hour spent in the traffic. Pollution is surely the most severe issue. Indeed, if all the people used to take a private car, then it is easely imaginable how much cars and fuel can be consumed daily. The two problems are linked, I want to underline, indeed, the noise pollution that derives from an intense traffic. It should be considered dangerous both for persons and animals. Two possible solutions to the problem of the over-reliance on cars are the following. Firstly, public trasportation should be improved. Indeed, if bus and tram were more safe and more confortable, then people would be more tent by their use. At least, they will solve the problem of traffic. On the other hand, I see the echologycal means of transport like bycicle as the new border to pass in order to save the world from pollution. One possible suggestion would be that of make cheaper the bycicle and also to give an economic subsidy to those people who decide to help the planet using them. In conclusion, I believe that the the use of private cars, because of the problems that it causes, should be discouraged. Two possible solutions rely on the improvement of public trasportation and on the incentive can be given to those using non-polluting means of trasport."}
{"text": "Today’s society overwhelmingly depends on products made from fossil fuels. Most people would initially think about fuel for transport, but of course, fossil fuels are part of most of the fabric of life around us, from the plastics on our furniture to the pavements that we walk on. Changing our reliance on these resources can have various consequences; however, I believe that overall the society will benefit from finding viable alternatives for them.Depending on whether eco-friendly alternatives are developed, the positive effect on transport and the reduction of the associated pollution will be significant. Exhaust fumes from motor vehicles, planes and ships decrease air quality and contribute to global warming and the greenhouse effect. People’s health and the health of the planet will surely improve without these industries relying on fossil fuels. It could be that a type of transport crisis could develop as a result if society can no longer provide the power to transport so many individuals to where they want to go. This, however, does not have to be a bad thing, as it could force society to use alternative solutions, such as transport sharing and public transport development. The change in mind set has already begun. Some countries have already committed to having fossil fuel free transport and more cities are banning private vehicles from the centre of cities.Another positive development would be that more time and money would have to be put into developing renewable sources of energy, such as wind power, solar power, hydropower and tidal power. Technologies would improve and be more efficient and again, the world would use fewer sources of energy that cause pollution. This development can also be seen today, with many governments committing to proportions of their power needs coming from renewable resources.I, therefore, strongly agree with the statement that the changes from reducing reliance on fossil fuels will be positive. The only caveat is that society will need to have developed alternative sources of power rather soon, in order to avoid an energy crisis."}

Whether it should be made easier for them to access university education becomes an ongoing concern, which incurs a highly-charged debate.Obviously, higher education opportunities bring about benefits to students in multiple ways. For example, higher education becomes increasingly important to senior high school graduates, partly it determines if they have the competitive edge in the job market, and partly because it is seen as a guarantee of a certain level of the mental ability, from the computer literacy that is required by the most employers to the capacities of acquiring new knowledge the soonest possible which is valued by most . With a university degree, students from rural areas obtain a job easily, thereby bettering their living conditions and their family as well.Higher education also, however, to impose a heavy burden on families since the rise in the tuition fees are increasingly beyond those families’ ability to afford. In addition, with the mounting evidence, a university degree is not always a guarantee of seizing a decent job; therefore, their living conditions are likely to able to earn back their tuition fee after graduation. people argue, students from rural areas are not well-advised to pursue a university degree. But I perceive their desire to further their education should not be disrespected and the government should subsidise them to receive higher education.In conclusion, university education should be made fair to everyone, predicated only on their academic performance and mental abilities, rather than their financial capacities and the government should subsidise those students in need.Teacher’s comment: Not all the parts of the task were covered.

{"text": "Parents and teachers in many countries are feeling increasingly concerned about the effect of digital devices on vital skills of school-aged children. They are alarmed by the declining ability of young people to read and write and its suspected link to the influence of modern technology, and I wholeheartedly share their view. This essay will outline the reasons to watch out for the consequences of widespread use of computers and mobile phones by our youngsters.Primary school is a very important period when children develop their fine motor skills, which are involved in learning to write. Time spent typing on a mobile phone or a tablet doesn’t contribute to the necessary workout of the small muscles in the hands and fingers of young people. Not only do they get less practice in writing but also fewer opportunities to train in spelling words, since the ‘autocorrect’ and ‘autocomplete’ features use the first few letters to guess the entire word, therefore making it unnecessary for the child to remember and type it correctly. Another companion of unrestrained use of mobile devices is the jargon that is often used in text messages, where words are shortened or distorted. Exposure to ‘texting’ tends to replace the correct words with abbreviations in young minds, causing their spelling accuracy to decline.Reading is another casualty of unrestricted access to smart devices. Video content can be more appealing and immersive for kids and they often are automatically drawn to it instead of books. Reading requires regular practice and needs to become a habit in order to fully develop as a skill; however, it is being perceived as a boring and labourious activity by many youngsters compared to effortless video-watching. Easy and instant access to videos and movies pushes books further down the list of preferences of young audience, and it takes a significant commitment from parents and teachers to ensure that children continue to read books.To sum up, modern technology can be a friend or a foe for young children, depending on the choices adults in their lives make, regulating the amount of screen time and its purpose. Without due care the writing and reading abilities of kids can be harmed by other, more enjoyable activities they can use the devices for."}
{"text": "In today’s ever-increasingly digital world, online communication has become the norm for many workplaces. While this development offers numerous advantages for companies such as greater flexibility and efficiency, it also brings with it certain disadvantages like miscommunication, which must be weighed against its benefits.One of the primary advantages of online communication is that it makes it easier for teams to stay in touch without having to physically convene. This is especially beneficial when individuals or groups are dispersed across vast distances. Reduced travel costs, as well as time saved from not having to travel to and from meetings, also represent meaningful savings for businesses. Additionally, online communication platforms often have a range of features designed to make collaboration more efficient, such as providing an easy way to share documents and other materials with remote team members. To illustrate, digital resources can be sent quickly and securely via email or other software services like Dropbox or Google Drive.There is a potential drawback associated with relying too heavily on online communication at work, as the lack of physical proximity between members of a team can often lead to misunderstandings due to a loss of context or nonverbal cues that would otherwise be present during face-to-face meetings. However, in my opinion, issues of this nature can be solved by using written language more carefully to avoid any confusion or miscommunication among colleagues.In conclusion, when online communication tools are used properly, they undoubtedly provide companies with greater flexibility in how their teams collaborate without sacrificing clarity of communication, quality or efficiency."}
{"text": "Should cultural places be charged? This question opens a big debate. On the one hand, there are some museums that require an admission fee to be paid. On the other hand, there are free-entry museums. I believe that if the charge to be paid is not expensive then it is right and fair to require an admission payment to visit a culutural place. In general, we used to believe that free is always better. However, I believe it is not a waste of money if they are spent to increase your knowledge. In Italy, for instance, museums and cultural places, in general, do not receive the economical support they need from the administrative centres. This phenomenon implies the following choice: either museums have to ask people to pay an entry fee or they have to stop taking care of the building and the artistic works they host. Then, I believe that to pay an admission fee is a way people, who are interested in art and in culture in general, can demonstrate their taking care of the place in which art is preserved. What should be the negative consequence of asking for an entry fee? In general, we believe that the money we spend is wasted. Although we spend them to obtain something we appreciate a lot, we always have the tendency to think that money should not be used and preserved. I cannot disagree with this way of thinking. However, I believe that spending money to pay a trisfling amount of money to get access to a cultural place is not a waste. Rather, it is a sort of investment for your personal culture and for the cultural building itself. What's more, generally, if people have to spend money to do any activity they used to enjoy as they can. As good materialists, we want to live the experience to respect the money spent. Then, paying an entry fee will encourage people who care about art to visit a museum rather than those who do not care. Art maybe is made less accessible but, in my opinion, will be more respected. The entry fee should not be (and in general is not) expensive. I cannot see why it should be seen as a loss of money to pay the entry fee of 5 euros to go inside the Louvre in Paris, the estraordinary Valle dei Templi in Sicily, or the magnificent Uffizi gallery in Florence. I believe that money could not be spent in a better way than to visit these places. In conclusion, I believe there are no real disadvantages caused by the payment of an entry fee, rather there are economic advantages that could help the administration of the museums in maintaining the quality of the service and preserving art works."}
{"text": "The World Cup football and the Olympics are held worldwide with great national support and expectations. As a fan of those competitions, I agree with the idea that sporting events can be necessary for international relations and national unity, but only partially, because such events can have unintended effects on relationships between countries.First of all, the World Cup, Olympics and other international games work for easing tensions among different nations. For example, South and North Korea have football games regularly two nations a chance to understand each other . In the mid of North Korean supporters came to South Korea with the footballers and they were very excited during the sporting events. Even if it sounds ridiculous, many South Koreans were quite surprised at that moment when North Koreans shouted and cried during the match. We all realized that they were very normal sports fans even though they were occasionally very secretive. Through the sports, two divided nations could reduce their political and ideological tensions and could feel the patriotic unity.On the other hand, some sports matches can make international relations worse. For instance, football or baseball games between Korea and Japan are always big matches in two countries where . Sometimes, after the matches, the two rivals blame each other and their patriotic emotions explode in an aggressive way. scenario is that the troubles caused by losing games affect the players directly."}
{"text": "The education of children is surely one of the hottest topic debated. What are the subjects and the skills that children have to learn and what help them to grow up better? According to one view, art is vital for the growht of children and therefore it has to be a school subject. On the other hand, there are people who think that to do art at school is a waste of time. I believe that to study art is fundamental for at least two different factors and then it should be teached in the schools. Surely, more dignity should be deserved to it. To study art at the different level of education is essential for the development of certain skills. First of all, those children who play with art develop the ability to measure, to structure a picture as well as delineate the border of a page earlier than those children who are not educated in drawing. They start recognising pictures and to distinguish between the colors and their possible mixtures. The second reason, by contrast, is linked with some psychological implications that to do art involves. To do art does not mean just to draw. Art can help adults to understand children and their needs. Children, thanks to the drawing activity, can start expressing their emotions and desire using pictures and colors. They can start working with their imagination before they learn the acquire the writing and reading skills. These two reasons lead some people to believe that is fundamental for children to do art. Then, art has to be a subject and considered as useful as Mathematics and English. The development of creativity and critical thinking that art implies is extraordinary useful. Indeed, children are led to understand practically what they have to do if they commit an error when they are drawing. They start to think about the errors they can made as possibility to do something new and original. By contrast, there are people who dislike the idea that art can be compared to other subjects like Math and Science. They believe that art is more an hobby than something useful. Since there are no notions that a child can memorise and there are not test a teacher can prepare to understand the level of the children, art cannot be considered a subject. Therefore, there are no reasons to teach it in schools. However, the reasons presented by those who do not want to add art in the list of school subjects are misguided. They start from the idea that to learn means to stay hours in front of a book. This is obsiusly true but it is not enough. There is a fundamental part of learning that is advantaged by practical activities like art. In conclusion, I believe that art is a subject and should be considered as such. The notions learnt by drawing are as essential as the first basis of grammar, keeping the necessary differences. Since children have to develop different skills, art as a school subject should be supported because it help children to develop at least creativity and critical reasoning as well as to express their emotions."}
{"text": "It is undeniable that nowadays, smart devices such as phones and tablets play an essential role in one's life. Through countless websites and applications, people can connect with each other without any boundaries. While many people agree that the introduction of these technologies has many disadvantages to the conservative way of starting and maintaining relationships, I personally believe that they rather develop new socializing methods. First and foremost, social medias and applications can help with keeping in touch with acquintances. Previously, people had to follow a precise time and location to meet up with their friends as they are unable to contact the others to reschedule. However, the internet allows them to update their plans at any time. This means that if there is any emergency, an individual can immediately postpone the upcoming event and find the next available slot to continue the plan. Furthermore, there are several applications that allow people to video call their friends and family who are currently living apart. The current technologies not only offer us options to communicate with our current contacts but also allow us to discover new friends. In the past, it is difficult to find people with a common interest which had to be done through social events. Nowadays, online communities enable their users to connect with new friends virtually. Thus, fewer individuals are left alone, especially introverts and those who are living in remote areas which can have difficulties socializing offline. All in all, despite the fact that there are many positive impacts of the invention of social medias and communication technologies, there are also risks and downsides of using them without face-to-face communication. Therefore, the time used for socializing online and offline should always be balanced."}
{"text": "Doing activities, either in a group or alone, play a crucial factor in terms of self-development, leading to strong skills for people’s life. Despite the fact that individual activities can improve a wide variety of people’s competencies, I personally believe that people would gain more benefits from participating team activities than doing individually. It is true that group activities potentially strengthen people’s social skills. An argument in favour of this is that team activities require participants to collaborate with other team members. As a result, the participants will not only have to do their responsibility the best, but also helping others bring out their best potential. This is because a team cannot achieve its goal by any person, but by everyone working together. Another common example is that group activities also foster people’s communication skills. In order to get what the team aim to succeed, each team members must deliver their messages via conversation in the simple and understandable way. Therefore, people doing group activities are likely to expose with this experience all time, helping them being capable of communicating effectively. In spite of the aforementioned advantages of doing activities as a team, it is the fact that doing individual activities also contributes to many essential skills. A classic example of this is the development in self-discipline. With respect to sports, people who doing sports alone such as running must strict with their running schedule in order to being able to run for their target distance. Another common criticism is the ability to not comparing themselves with others. When people doing activities alone, they will have to set their milestones to reach their target, meaning that they will truly understand their actual potential and not interfered by other people’s progress. In conclusion, it is undeniable that individual activities possibly help people have self-discipline and teach them to concentrate on their ability, not others. Nevertheless, after carefully contemplating the outcomes of both types of activities, I totally agree that group activities which result in better teamwork and communication skills are more important due to the fact that these competencies are the two most important factors for every people to be successful in life."}
{"text": "The feasibility of shopping, working and communicating through the Internet is gradually eliminating the necessity of in-person encounters. I believe the merits of this opportunity outnumber its demerits and the lowered volume of traffic in addition to the possibility of long-range communication will be discussed as reasons for this claim in this essay.One chief benefit of using the Internet as a means of making purchases, working and communicating would be the lowered demand for transport, through eradicating the need for face-to-face contact. Such decreased volume of transportation would result in fewer harmful gas emissions which could significantly contribute to creating a cleaner environment. Furthermore, reduced commuting burden yields more free time for individuals. It could be spent in various ways such as working, studying and socialising with family and friends to name a few, which would be more productive and enjoyable.Another key merit of using the Internet would be the emergence of state-of-the-art telecommunication applications. These technologies have made it possible for those with access to the Internet to get in touch and send and receive audiovisual content by pushing just a few buttons. This presents a stark contrast to the situation only a few decades ago, when long-distance communication was possible solely through paper-based letters, which could possibly take months to reach the recipient.There are, however, some drawbacks to online communication, in particular the possibility that the lack of contact brought by technological advancements could potentially weaken human bonds. Taking into consideration that humans are sociable species, this could pose a dire threat to our mental health. This predicament, however, would be mitigated by the extra free time technological developments create for us. This free time could be spent with friends and family and in the long run would strengthen our relationships and improve our emotional wellbeing.To recapitulate, the Internet’s demolishing the need for person-to-person contact brings about numerous benefits. A more sustainable environment as well as more free time generated for individuals, a reduced need to commute in addition to the feasibility of conducting long-distance communication in the easiest way possible, are all instances of the above-mentioned merits."}
{"text": "Many people support use of animals for testing medicines for humans. Others believe it isn’t appropriate to use animals for such experiments. Discuss both views and give your own opinion.Sample EssayApproval of the medicines for human use is a tedious process which involves a series of tests often performed on animals. While some people support this idea because it makes drugs safer for human consumption, others believe that it is an unethical practice. Personally, I am in favour of the idea that medicines should be tested in all possible scenarios before being released to the public.Those against animal experimentation argue that animals have the same rights as human beings because they are the outcome of the same evolution process through which humans came into existence. Infecting them with viruses and exposing them to bacteria, to create a conducive environment to test a chemical substance may cause excruciating pain to these lab animals. Any failed test can mean that the subject either loses its precious life or suffers for the rest of its existence, and understandably, some people are against what they consider an immoral practice.Nonetheless, if a drug is released into the market without a thorough end-to-end testing, it could cause severe damage to anyone who may consume it. Every day a large number of animals are being mercilessly killed by humans for their mere flesh and skin. There isn’t a big difference between killing an animal for food and sacrificing its life for testing a chemical composition, because both actions are helping the human race to survive. What’s more, the life of one animal used to test a life-saving drug could help many people live. This is why a large number of people believe that testing drugs on animals is a matter of survival.To sum up, there are valid reasons why animal testing seems cruel and unacceptable to some, and crucial to others. In my opinion, even though animals subjected to testing may suffer, it is a necessary step to ensure the healing power of a drug."}
{"text": "Nowadays families move to different countries for work. Some people think it has a negative effect on children, while others disagree. Discuss both views and give your own opinion.Recent advancements, in technology and transportation in particular, are reshaping our world in an unprecedented manner. Nowadays, it is not unusual for people to work abroad. Most expatriates relocate their families to the countries . Some people argue that this phenomenon negatively affects children, however, I agree with those who believe the opposite is true.Those who think that relocating children to a new place is undesirable do so for many reasons. Their most common argument is the negative impact of moving on a child’s personality. There is no doubt that living in a different community comes with its challenges, especially to young people, as they get exposed to behaviours, actions and customs they might not be familiar with. As a result, children could possibly feel a lack of stability and some confusion. It is also likely that their patriotic feelings and sense of belonging to their home country could weaken as they would miss many opportunities to celebrate their national events.Nevertheless, I firmly believe that opinion to be ludicrous, as it seems that getting exposed to a new culture is beneficial in many ways. It fosters young social and emotional capabilities. Moreover, children living abroad have better opportunities to and practice new languages. Mastering more than one language improves not only their intellectual development, but also their opportunities in acquiring better jobs in the future. According to a recent study published by the University of Chicago, competency in more than one language increases employment chances on average by 200%.In conclusion, I strongly believe that living in a different country positively affects children in all aspects. Acquiring new languages, and an open minded and tolerant personality are just few examples of the many possible benefits.This essay presents a well‐developed position that addresses all parts of the task prompt."}

Their daily meals consist of fast food which contains large amounts of fat and salt. The most significant of this unhealthy lifestyle is the weight gain especially among those middle age working professionals.Therefore, most of these young and energetic people have to control their diet in order to stay in shape either for their appearance or health.

{"text": "It is not uncommon for teenagers to worship celebrities. From singers to actors, many young people around the world look up to these stars and attempt to emulate their lifestyles. In my opinion, allowing children to idolize celebrities can often be detrimental, as they frequently set a poor example.Many of today’s celebrities tend to lack moral values, and they promote behaviour inappropriate for young people. For instance, some music videos feature explicit lyrics glorifying drug use and violence. In addition, the media often reports on celebrities who indulge in excessive partying or drinking alcohol despite being underage. These types of headlines can have a negative influence on impressionable teens who might falsely believe that they should follow suit to appear cool or successful.Poor morals aren’t the only issue, as many popular stars are also well-known for their irresponsible spending habits. They routinely splurge on luxury items such as designer clothing or expensive cars without any consideration for budgeting or saving money responsibly. This kind of behaviour is dangerous because it is normalizing materialism and teaching teens that costly possessions will bring them happiness instead of focusing on what really matters in life: meaningful relationships, knowledge, and hard work.To conclude, young adults should keep in mind that society’s perception of fame and fortune is based on temporary, insubstantial things rather than what actually matters. In the grand scheme of things, it would be far more beneficial for teenagers to spend time developing their own set of values rooted in quality education and strong family relationships."}
{"text": "My custom topic: It is important for people to take risks, in both their professional lives and personal lives. Do the advantages of taking these risks outweigh the disadvantages? I personally think that taking risks is inevitable in this day and age. There may be some drawbacks, but there it cannot be denied that there are certainly benefits. Firstly, risks are necessary for us to move forward. Without risks, there would be no innovation, and without innovation, there will be no progress for humankind. Humankind is built on the foundation of risk-takers who not only achieved their goals of making the world a better place but also learnt to ability to get back up after their countless failures. Secondly, by not taking the chance provided and taking a risk, they are missing out on amazing opportunities that could never be achieved unless you have the confidence, determination and conviction to follow the unknown path ahead. These opportunities could easily get them ahead in life, and they would never come true unless they stroll out of their conform zone. Althought that is the case, it is undeniable that the amount of risk for professional and personal lives is vastly different. If they fail in their personal life, this could hurt in the short term, for example, you could need financial support if you had a family feud. This short-term loss could be a disadvantage in life, but it may not be as crucial as its effect on professional lives, for example, a career change could involve a big pay cut, which could be quite influential on professional lives. Overall, taking risks could turn out to be a loss in the short term, but it is greatly outweighed by all the upsides taking a risk could bring."}
{"text": "The debate over whether it is better to own or rent the property in which one lives is one that has strong supporters on each side. There are persuasive arguments for both points of view.One of the main advantages of renting a property is flexibility. Usually, a tenant only has to give a month’s notice before changing where he or she lives. If a property is owned and a change is needed, the property must be put onto the market and it is frequently a long and stressful process to get a sale completed. Sometimes, the wrong time of year or a bad market can mean that a sale is not possible. Another advantage of renting is that a large amount of a family’s capital is not tied up in the property. Property can cost hundreds of thousands of dollars and often a lot more. If one rents, this money can be spent on other things to help improve the family’s quality of life. If the property is on a mortgage, then the deposit, also often very large, is tied up in the property and the pressure of having to make substantial payments every month can cause a lot of stress.Owning a property does have various advantages, though. Even though people usually have to service a mortgage every month with payments, this money is then built up with the property. With renting, the money is lost to the landlord, but at the end of the term of the mortgage, the whole property is owned by the family. This makes the process of living in a property a type of investment. In addition, the property’s value often goes up after time, frequently creating a substantial profit. Owning the property where one lives can also create a sense of well-being and self-actualisation.The decision to whether one rents or owns the property in which one lives really boils down to individual preference. My opinion is that it is much more preferable to own a property, mainly because it creates a valuable asset for the family."}
{"text": "Some people think that schools should select students according to their academic abilities, while others believe that it is better to have students with different abilities studying together. Discuss both views and state your own opinion.Some people contend that mixed ability classes are more beneficial for children’s development than streaming them on the basis of judgement about their academic abilities. However, from my perspective, I disagree with this contention.Admittedly, mixed ability classes provide a better environment for children’s all-round development. In such classes, children with different abilities study together and in turn they can learn from one another. From example, a student, who is good at academic study but weak in dancing or painting, can learn how to dance or paint his peers. In this sense, mixed ability classes allow students to develop their abilities in different subjects instead of only academic abilities.Despite the argument above, I believe streaming students brings more benefits to teachers and students. As for teachers, separating children with better academic abilities from others facilitates effective teaching. This practice helps teachers to control their students more conveniently and easily. Compared with mixed ability in which teacher should consider students’ differences when they are using teaching methodologies, streaming makes this situation simpler. To be more specific, students are at the same level of academic ability in a class, and in turn teachers can use the same methodologies for them all. In this way, the narrower the spread of ability in the class, the more convenient the teaching can be.On top of this, enables students to learn in an effective way. According to students’ different abilities, they are taught in different ways that are more suitable for them. In the top streams, students use more difficult materials, therefore, they can learn more. In sharp contrast, teachers can explain the material more slowly to those in bottom streams. Under this circumstance, students with different academic abilities can study effectively and efficiently.In the final analysis, mixed ability classes are beneficial for students’ versatile development, but in my opinion, segregating students based on different academic ability is better for both teachers and students."}
{"text": "Some cities create new housing for their growing populations by constructing a smaller number of high-rise buildings. Other cities create more of low-rise buildings. Which solution is better, in your opinion?Sample EssayRising population in urban areas leaves governments with no choice but to build more houses to meet the demand. However, when it comes to construction, there is more than one way to build new homes. Some cities prefer to construct fewer residential towers, while others build a larger number of low-rises for their residents. In this essay both options will be discussed and a viable solution will be suggested.One advantage of tall buildings is that they can accommodate a large number of people while having a small footprint. This type of construction is popular in central city areas where land is scarce and expensive. For example, in New York City high-rise buildings have significantly reduced housing problems, by as much as 55% in the last few years. As a result of this strategy, rents tend to decrease which has a further positive impact on the economies of such cities. However, tall buildings offer little or no privacy, they force certain rules and regulations upon residents, and attract higher maintenance costs.Given a chance to voice their opinion, many individuals would prefer to live in low-rise buildings or even build their own houses. This option might be more attractive for big families and for older generation people who like to have their own personal space. Accessibility is also a concern for the elderly as taking the stairs when the lifts break down may not be an option for them. In addition, one or two-story houses are easier and cheaper to maintain compared to modern apartment towers. The downside of this type of dwellings is that they occupy much more land, and since land is cheaper on city fringes, new estates tend to be built away from city centres. This increases commute time to work for their residents and negatively affects their quality of life.In conclusion, high-rise and low-rise buildings have their unique advantages and disadvantages. In my opinion, high rises are more suitable for younger residents and should be built in the areas where young population is prevalent, closer to the city centre and employment opportunities. Senior citizens should have a supply of lower dwellings available in quieter locations. Such flexible approach can be a good way to address the needs of growing city’s population."}
{"text": "In recent years, the crisis of food wasting has drawn the attention from all over the world. In my perspective, there are reasons to this problem and some measures should be taken into effect to reduce the amount of wasted food. Franklly speaking, based on my observation, there are several factors that leads to the food-wasting crisis. Firstly, with the aid of modern technology, especially those related to farming industry, we can get much more stable access to all kinds of crops than our predecessors, which means we no longer need to live in a food-saving lifestyle, thus leading to a number of wastes in terms of food. Secondly, due to lack of educations on saving food in school, the youngsters nowadays tend to be unaware of the importance of adequete food. As a result, people are used to order more amount of food than they actually need, constituting more food is wasted everyday. Finally, as the burgeon of economy in most countries, the fashion of showing off to others is curved into the mind of pubilc, resulting a number of extravegent consuming that could cost plenty of food wasted. Since the problem of food wasting is taking place everywhere around the globe right now, it is urgent for us to take some actions to deal with the problem. In my opinion, as it is impossible to reverse the development of science, we should then focus on educaitions, specifically children's education. For example, several lectures could be given to the elementary school students to highlight the hardships to grown crops for our ancestors, as well as the reason why we should save the food we eat everyday. On top of that, the autorities could organise the student for some visits to the farming field, where they can learn the basic knowledges needed for farming industry and then understand how harsh it is to grow food that is sold on market nowadays. Once the children aware of the importance of saving food, there certainly will be less food thrown away on a day to day basis. To sum up, both technologies and lack of public education give birth to food wasting. Althogh several methods could be taken to deal with the problem, it is through our joint effort to reduce the food thrown away everday. Actions need to be implemented swiftly."}
{"text": "While some people argue that parents should take sole responsibility for disciplining their children, others take the view that the government should be in charge of such matters. In my opinion, the young generation should be primarily guided by their parents where rules of behavior and moral principles are concerned. However, in some instances government intervention is necessary.On one side of the argument, there are people who hold the opinion that the responsibility of disciplining a child falls squarely on parents’ shoulders, since they are their first educators, and it is their duty to equip their children with good manners and morals even before their first day at school. In addition, every family has a unique understanding of what a suitable form of discipline entails. Therefore, some parents are concerned that any form of punishment meted out at school might be too harsh. To overcome this issue, they believe that parents should be informed by the school of their child’s wrongdoing so that they could decide an appropriate consequence for their behavior at home.Unfortunately, not all parents are objective enough to make the right decisions when it comes to the upbringing of their children. Some may lack information or sound moral background to discipline their children in a meaningful way. Therefore, the state should shoulder some of the responsibility by implementing a strict set of guidelines and policies on how to discipline children at school. I believe that such policies result in children who flourish and are more likely to become productive citizens that actively contribute to a prosperous nation. Also, this would help both parents and teachers understand which punishments are suitable for minor infractions like missing an assignment or major incidents like bullying or skipping school.In conclusion, while both views are commonly held in society, I believe that the government must be actively involved in the policies related to discipline at schools as this would ensure the well-being and successful development of the youth."}
{"text": "In recent years, computer use around the world has increased drastically. As a result technological equipment is used increasingly in schools around the world. Many people question therefore whether schools should put much emphasis on teaching students basic handwriting skills and mental mathematics skills.The use of technological equipment in lessons has increased since the onset of the digital age. Nearly all professions around the world involve computer use and even the simplest tasks are carried out via electronic equipment. Hence, it is important for students to learn how to use technology correctly for their future careers. Electronic devices also offer various learning advantages, as notes and assignments can be completed much faster and more neatly using these tools.Nonetheless, the practical skills such as using and holding a pen correctly are likewise vital for future careers. For that reason, students have to be taught at early ages how to carry out simple tasks using basic skills, such as writing. It is also essential that a student develops neat handwriting, as in the case of a technological problem the student will have to write by hand. Furthermore, final exams are typically written by hand and thus the student must develop the basic skill of holding a pen and writing with it. Mathematics skills are no different. People will not always have a device with them to carry out calculations and the ability to do arithmetic in the head is a vital skill for operating in today’s world.In conclusion, I personally believe that schools should keep a balance between using practical skills and using electronic equipment to carry out certain tasks by having student submit assignments created electronically, yet also by having them complete assignments by hand in class and without computers or calculators. This balance is important, as if the focus lies only on one of the two aspects, the student will face problems later on in life."}
{"text": "The topic of whether students should choose a specific specialized in limited subjects or all students need to study a wide range of subjects until they graduate school, has been discussed across the world, including in Japan. Although there are some benefits to the education system which specialize in some specific subject, I think to learn wide range of subjects until they leave school. For example, there are some courses which focus on some specific industry in Japan. Specifically, it is geared toward hair stylists, IT programming, and entertainment. It is useful for them to learn the specific curriculums earlier might be advantageous to master these techniques. Especially, when it comes to entertainment, younger talented people tend to be evaluated higher than older talented people. On the other hand, there are some benefits to learn a variety of subjects until they leave high school. For example, learning mathematics will allow us to boost some skills to predict and solve some issues logically. And learning English will be an essential tool to communicate with people worldwide. In addition, people have often required a variety of educational knowledge in daily conversation, especially in the workplace. This means that learning a wide range of subjects is helpful to bear out their variety of educational backgrounds. Finally, it might be difficult for teenagers, especially fifteen years old students to decide which occupation, and industry they would like to work. Teenagers have often deluded and changed their idea about which occupation is suitable for them, however, they have some specific dreams in advance. Therefore, learning a wide range of subjects will be helpful to decide a variety of occupations in the future. This means that if students had learned a wide range of subjects until high school, it will be helpful to consider a long time and let them decide on a variety of job occupations. Then, they should choose the specific faculty they would like to learn at university."}
{"text": "Today, the advertising has become very powerfull thanks to the television and the internet. But is it true that it is now more important in terms of sail rates, than the goods themselves and the actual requests of the society? First of all, I think that usually in the one selected price range, all the products serving the same purpose have more or less equal properties such as quality or taste. This is indeed true, for example, for many electronic devices which are are produced by the nearby factories somewhere in China regardless the brand, and therefore their sales depend more on marketing strategies. However, if the one buys the goods of well known brand, he trusts the experience beneath this brand. This is a kind of assurance that a consumer gets excactly what he expects and that a product is not defective. For instance, when choosing the car, you probably would firstly consider BMW or Mercedec. The reason why you know them is not only good advertising, but also quality proved by millions of clients throughout the years. Moreover, I believe that modern society actually moves towards the conscious consumption. This implies people becoming more and more awared of product and its manufactoring process ratheer than advertising. From that the decreasing of the aggressive marketing follows, though the marketing still has cruical role. In fact its focus changes so that it will become more informative and less disturbing in the future. In conclusion I want to disclose my own point of view. I do agree with the topic to the certain extent, though I am sure advertising is only a one reason of high sales, among many others and its influence will decrease with time."}
{"text": "In this digital era, people always use the computer to assist their life, including education programs in school. It is so essential that most schools provide computers in the classrooms for their students. However, if the student is too dependent on computers, it will have two impacts, either drawbacks or benefits. In this essay, I will explain my opinion about both sides with relevant examples and experiences. If we go back twenty years, only a few schools already have computers in their classrooms to support their education programs. Nevertheless, as technology never stops improving, thus the computer itself is getting cheaper every day. Hence, most schools can afford to provide computers in their classrooms now, and there will always be risks involved with that. In this case, a student who relies so much on computers may need more social skills, as the interaction between student and teacher will be less, that caused by the materials and exercises will be delivered online or by any application programs. Despite the risks, there are also several benefits that students can gain from computers. First, it will provide much positive information or knowledge, not only related to Information Technology but also to other matters. For example, schools can provide an e-learning program for any subject, containing materials to be learned and exercises to be done anywhere and anytime. Besides that, a computer will assist the teacher when reviewing the student's homework. In conclusion, the benefits of computer dependency in classrooms sometimes outweigh the drawbacks. Eventually, students can study more anywhere and anytime, although there will be a risk related to social concern."}
{"text": "Childcare training courses should be mandatory for all parents. Do you agree or disagree with this statement? Give your own opinion and include relevant examples.It is true that parents need some knowledge and experience in order to raise their in an appropriate way. In this regard, many families attend different training courses. While I agree that these courses might be useful for some of them, I totally disagree with the recommended obligatory of such training.On the one hand, training courses usually offered by governments could be very useful for those guardians who have a with special needs. For example, if a child has a birth defect or has been diagnosed with any mental or musculoskeletal disorders, these kinds of training could be lifesaving. Additionally, as we know, the first few months after birth are really a crucial period of a child’s life; parents should obtain different information related to their child’s vaccinations, common health problems, different developmental issues and so on, which can be delivered through such training courses.On the other hand, I believe that making these programs a mandatory option would cause several problems for societies and individuals as well. To begin with, in order to achieve this goal, many professionals should be trained which may not be affordable for some governments. From an individual’s point of view, this kind of programs could be very time-consuming for some families who have other at home or who work long hours. The other important consideration is that parent training courses may not provide all the necessary information for each and every family. To be more specific, parents could get more beneficial information through different websites such as YouTube according to their own preferences.In conclusion, although I believe that many families can take advantage training courses, I do believe that making them a compulsory option for everyone is too time and money-consuming for individuals and governments.The introduction is very good and relevant."}
{"text": "While recruiting a new employee, the employer should pay more attention to their personal qualities, rather than qualifications and experience. To what extent do you agree or disagree? Give your opinion and include relevant examples.Recent decades have witnessed a burgeoning growth of numerous industries; therefore, recruiting the right person for the position is crucial to the development of enterprises. But how do we determine if a person is the best fit? Advocates of conventional recruitment methods opine that this candidate must have sufficient experience and qualifications needed for that job. Nevertheless, some people argue that candidates’ personal qualities cannot be ignored. In my view, both components are of equal importance.To begin with, the conventional approach of checking potential workers’ qualifications via their resumes, LinkedIn profiles, issued qualifications and certifications from authorised organisations is vital. Apparently, whenever we submit a job application, we are always required to attach a CV while a cover letter is optional. Without a decent qualification, even if that candidate’s personal characteristics are suitable, the enterprise will need to carry out lots of skill trainings eventually.On the other hand, occasionally during an interview some HR officers ignore the significance of assessing how candidates’ individual qualities can fit in the company. Employers should assess not only candidates’ qualifications but also their enabling skills, ethics and value propositions. The more an employee’s personal qualities fit in a company’s culture and values, the more he or she is motivated to contribute to that company’s vision. KPMG is a great example of evaluating candidates’ personal qualifications and skills by utilising a game-based assessment process, followed by a video interview. This methodology enables a comprehensive assessment, and is embraced by many companies nowadays.To summarise, employers should assess both personal characteristics and formal qualifications when recruiting people as each of these elements has its own vital contribution to make in talent-seeking enterprises.This response covers the topic well."}

It is a very controversial and complicated matter., many people believe this statement, for many reasons. Firstly, all of us had made many mistakes which we would not like to remember, they will affect their present because they can create some problems with our families example. Secondly, instead of remembering those past trials, one should get the benefits of their present.Regardless of what I said previously, many people are sticking to their past to give themselves a push in their present. It can give a way of learning from mistakes, and a good chance to try to avoid anything that once lead to a past failure.Moreover, success will not come without failure, everybody should make an attempt, even if it fails, and it may become a big success if they try it again and again. In addition, our past is our culture and heritage which we should not forget at all, it is a matter of value to our present and future, and will remain such till the day will die.To sum up, in my opinion, we can not live without a past, it is our value of life. it can help create your experiences and solve your problems better in the future."}
{"text": "Many parents encourage young people to leave home when they become older, while others think they should stay at home with the family. Discuss both views and give your own opinion.With the tremendous influence of modernisation, remarkable changes have taken place in the family structure to such an extent that nowadays, youngsters are motivated by their parents to live alone as they grow up. However, some people are of the view that it is more practical for a youngster to live with their family.On the one hand, there are many positive aspects to youths living away from their parents at young age. This provides the opportunity to young people to live a life on their own terms and make any decisions without the interference of their parents. Besides, living alone not only makes them independent but also makes them self-reliant, which is a crucial life skill to their successful career. For instance, managing all the house chores such as cleaning, paying bills, cooking and so on will make them well experienced at learning and managing diverse activities and will also boost their confidence.On the other hand, there is no denying the fact that youngsters living away from their family may find themselves in circumstances that may adversely affect their life. Naïve and inexperienced young people in the absence of parental supervision are more likely to fall prey to bad influence and dangerous activities, such as drugs or alcohol consumption, which may jeopardise their career or lead them astray from moral values. However, this situation is less likely to take place with youngsters still living with their parents. Besides, emotional bonding and family relationships can be maintained better if everyone is living together under one roof.In my opinion, although encouraging youngsters to live alone may lead them to learn various life skills, negative aspects and risks associated with living alone can far outweigh the benefits.This response covers the task topic well, by discussing the positive and negative aspects of living alone as a young adult, and the writer’s opinion has also been included. Paragraphing helps to present ideas in an orderly way, and cohesion and coherence are maintained throughout the essay. There is some repetitive use of the word ‘make’ in the first body paragraph, which could have been avoided. Apart from that, the writer’s vocabulary seems to be quite rich and allows them to communicate ideas precisely and clearly."}
{"text": "It is certainly true that many people around the world find their lives dominated by the work that they have to do. This is shown when you realise how people’s work, and how much time, effort and resources they devote to it, is often the subject of conversation.Most people depend on their jobs to generate an income to pay for their lives’ necessities and luxuries, and so work can naturally become a dominating focus. As this is an important part of nearly everyone’s everyday life, it can seem that people’s lives are indeed becoming more influenced by their jobs. Whether this emphasis on work is more significant now than in previous years is debatable. In many developed countries around the world, there are procedures in place to help people with finding work, providing unemployment benefits, ensuring education, and offering pension payments. In times past, these provisions were not in place and a job or business was required to provide the necessary income.Therefore, in spite of increases in the cost of living in many places around the world, it can be argued there is actually less pressure than in previous years to keep one’s job and perform well at it. This, in turn, would lead to people’s lives being less influenced by their jobs today. It is also true that in the past, people were as responsible and focused on doing well in their responsibilities as today and so, in this respect, the people of the past would be equally dedicated to their work as people are today.While I agree that people’s lives today are often dominated by their jobs, I feel that the current situation is not necessarily worse than before. In fact, it may be more positive, due to the fewer pressures to earn money in many countries."}
{"text": "The public is rarely found agreeing on one opinion. One might take a simpe problem such as manufacturers responsible for excessive packaging, or customers should avoid buying such goods as example. Let me tackle this problem in brief. Manufacturers and supermarkets may be noticed selling their goods excessivly packaged, and that may dissatisfy a portion of their customers. Those customers believe that such sellers should reduce such packaging. Looking into it, it sounds that sellers would also be responsible if their goods where damaged, which would lead to a decrease in income. It also does cost a little more to wrap goods securely to avoid damage, so while that may be a little inconvenient for manufacturers, it is necessary to avoid serious losses later on. Customers have full right to avoid excessivly packaged goods, if it so contrasts their taste. They may feel it is tiresome to unwrap, or hard to get rid of all the mess it creates afterwords. They would think that is a manufacturer's task to unwrap the goods once they are available at the market, or even once the arrive at their houses if it is an online service. It would logically seem much convenient to them to have instant access to their product instead of all the unpackaging that preceeds the unboxing purchased goods. Personally, I believe a little unwrapping isn't so invonvenient, and it doesn't have to fall on a manufacturer to unwrap his goods before selling. A little unpackaging might even be thrilling sometimes, to build up excitement before unboxing your awaited product. I'd add, with little offense meant, that people are getting a little lazy to do a simple task as unpackaging."}
{"text": "Generally, in our real lives, failure and successful events usually are seen in workplaces, sports and in families. Actually i completely disagree that the act of failing is caused by a lack of desire and motivation. There are many different factors which influence our failure and success. Firstly, the most recent event which affected significantly most of people's motivation, is the Covid-19 pandemic. The last two years there the number of business failure increased significantly due to lockdowns and victims by pandemic. For example the first lockdown in Europe happened in Italy in 2020, which restaurants, leisure facilities and shopping centres were obliged to close for more than one year. The consequence of this, was the loss of customers and the accumulation of debt, which led to many failures, because people had difficulties paying their bills and taxes. On the other hand, failure could happen if people has no desire to expand their horizons. For example many developed companies that accept paying their employees larger amount of money, this action could cause laziness to company's members, even they could be absent from work. All that happens because of complacency. Consequently this can amount in dismissal and ruin their job's career and reputation in terms of work experience. Taking all of this into account, failure it doesn't only depend on peoples' personality and behaviour, but is also caused by external factors, influencing dramatically people's lives in terms of profit."}

{"text": "In many countries around the world, boys and girls are educated together. There is a group of countries, however, that educate boys and girls separately. This is frequently done on religious grounds, but not always. Having such a system can produce various advantages and disadvantages.One of the principal reasons for educating boys and girls separately is that, if they are together, they can distract each other. After puberty, boys can be strongly attracted to girls and vice versa, and this can result in disruptive conduct in the classroom as, for example, they show off to one another. Separating boys and girls can therefore have the distinct advantage of reducing this disturbing behaviour. However, some teachers have pointed out that this model does not always work, and that separated boys and girls are equally disruptive in class, and sometimes more so. These teachers say that having the opposite sex in the classroom can actually improve behaviour.Many educators also believe that boys and girls have different learning styles and needs. Separating boys and girls can allow teachers to address these needs more easily. There is also a belief that single sex schools allow gender stereotypes to be challenged and therefore education aspirations can be broadened.A major disadvantage of separating boys and girls in education is that the children miss important formative behavioural development when they do not have interaction with the other gender on a regular basis. This can lead to shyness and, more seriously, dysfunctional relationships later in life. Some people also feel that mixed sex schools can promote gender stereotypes rather than reducing them.In conclusion, I feel that children should be educated all together, although I would respect a system in which they are separated due to religious beliefs. My personal opinion is that different genders should learn to interact together from an early age, as this would allow them to develop healthy working relationships with each other."}
{"text": "In many countries around the world young people decide to leave their parents’ home once they finish school. They start living on their own or sharing a house with friends. Is this a positive or a negative development? Give reasons for your answer and include relevant examples.Sample EssayNowadays it is becoming increasingly common for youngsters to start their independent life by moving out of their parents’ home after graduation from school. This trend has positive effects on the society and the reasons behind it will be discussed next in this essay.There are various benefits for both young people and their parents when individuals start living independently after finishing school. Young adults, in this way, have to take care of their daily needs, from house chores, cooking or cleaning to financial independence. Thus, instead of wasting time on childish activities, they are motivated to learn skills and work part-time or full-time in order to cover their living expenses. Although it might seem challenging for them to live on their own at first, it would give them valuable experience, helping them to become mature, responsible adults. Parents would also be pleased with this practice since they can enjoy their own lives by having more time for themselves. Not only would they have more financial flexibility due to independence of their children, but they also don’t have to change their habits in order to adapt to the new generation’s lifestyle. For instance, it allows many people to travel around the world, which would be impossible if their children were to stay with them after finishing high school.Admittedly, there might be some challenges involved in this way of life. In some cases and especially under the influence of new friends or housemates, youngsters might choose to get involved in dangerous activities that involve drugs or petty crimes. However, instead of keeping their children close through adulthood, parents should prepare in advance and raise their children to distinguish between right and wrong and teach them to take responsibility for their actions.In conclusion, although there might be some adverse consequences to this relatively new practice, I believe that the advantages of young people leaving family home outweigh its drawbacks, for both children and parents."}
{"text": "An increasing number of individuals are taking the decision to have cosmetic surgery in order to achieve a better appearance. I strongly believe that mass media advertising and lower costs of surgery are the reasons for the above. Likewise, I think that it is a negative development for our society. To begin with, it is very well known that mass media advertising and lower costs of surgery affect the behaviour of the citizens. Mass media advertising is promoting an uncommon archetype among the population. Plenty of men and women feel that they do not have sex appeal due to the fact that their bodies are different to those shown on television. Moreover, cosmetic surgery costs are more affordable nowadays than before. Hence, several women receive cosmetic surgery as a birthday gift. Additionally, I strongly believe that taking the decision to have cosmetic surgery reflects a negative development in our communities for the reason that it reveals that plenty of people have mental health issues. For instance, low self-esteem has been increasing among the young population during the last years. Besides that, cosmetic surgery centres the attention on beauty instead of other more important values, such as honesty, creativity and charity. For example, there are fewer Non-Governmental Organizations such as Green Peace at the present moment than in the past. To conclude, harmful mass media advertising and lower costs of cosmetic surgery translate into a negative development in our communities due to mental health issues and citizens spending money on nonsense. I would strongly recommend that authorities create laws to regulate mass media advertising."}
{"text": "It is no secret that today’s entertainment industry is extremely popular, with nearly everyone being engaged at some time in watching TV shows, movies and sports games. The North American sports industry alone generates a massive $67.7 billion every year. With the present emphasis on entertainment, sportsmen and women and professional entertainers can earn enormous salaries, with figures in the millions for one game, appearance or film. This situation certainly does reflect today’s society’s obsession with entertainment.Many people argue that celebrities do not deserve such payment when work in other professions considered of equal or higher value to society is underpaid. A-list celebrities can make over $20 million per movie, whilst many average workers can barely make ends meet. Of course there are lots of people who say that there are better ways the money could be used, rather than allowing such a vast amount to go to just one person. This is a fairly naive point of view, though. So long as people wish to watch entertainment, advertising in turn will be present and the most watched celebrities will be able to earn high salaries, as their presence will ensure the high viewing figures the advertisers desire.Though celebrities and sportsmen and sportswomen often make very large sums of money, it can also be seen as unfair to say that they do not deserve it or propose their money be used for something else. While it is true that they did not find a cure for cancer or made a life-changing scientific discovery, their hard work and expertise created a product that the public wants to see and the high payment merely reflects their value.In conclusion, it is clear that today’s society is indeed a society obsessed with being entertained and the high salaries paid to those who entertain society clearly reflect this. The high payments, however, are not necessarily out of place or undeserved."}
{"text": "Some people believe that women should be treated as equal to men when applying for a job with the police or the military. Others think that women are less suitable for this kind of job. Discuss both views and give your opinion.Sample EssayIn recent years gender equality in employment has been the topic of heated debate. While some may argue that women are less suited for certain jobs such as with the police or the military, I believe that female candidates should be treated the same as their male counterparts.Those who consider women to be unsuited for some kinds of jobs including the police or the military often hold that opinion because such jobs are extremely physically demanding. As the female body has smaller muscles and less physical strength compared to male body, women may have difficulty engaging in strenuous activity which can be exhausting even for men. In military service, female soldiers are more likely to struggle while defending themselves than their male peers when they are forced to move around carrying heavy firearms in the battle, which can increase their risk of mission failure. Because of the hazards and extreme conditions they may encounter, some people advocate that women are not suitable for work in these fields.Nevertheless, I believe that female applicants should be considered for police or military placements without a gender bias, because women are more suited to certain tasks. In the police service, female officers can perform important roles on some occasions such as a body search where male officers are restricted from touching female convicts. In the military service, female nursing staff are more likely to care better for injured soldiers since maternal instinct makes them dedicated and heart-warming professionals. Furthermore, for the sake of fairness to all, job seekers should have an equal opportunity to choose their jobs freely, regardless of gender. Many women have the desire to work in the police and the military and some of them have relevant expertise and qualifications. Therefore, they should not be discriminated against in employment opportunities for these jobs.In conclusion, although some say that women are incompatible with police and military duties because of the high physical demands, I believe that they should be treated as equal to men. This is because there are certain roles with the police and the military that are more suitable for women than men, and therefore both genders should have equal employment opportunities."}

In this world, any employees who possess enough abilities and work in an effective way, be promoted to positions. Therefore, allocating the high level positions in companies to women is not necessary. Moreover, the instances of women in essential positions . Those women are very successful in their work and their lives.In conclusion, although the inequality between men and women has reduced, it still is a social issue worth . Personally, in my opinion we should create as many opportunities for women to have an equal life as we can."}
{"text": "Our actions in Present time are product of the Past. It also concerns the Judge sphere. But sometimes laws and jury has no access to the information from defectant's background. Some peple - including lawyers - believe the accused person's past is very important. I completely argee with it and in this essay I will support my piont of view with some arguments. Firstly, without knowing defectant's past, he could to throw everyone off the scent. Persons who are being accused of the crime usually try to soften their sentence. Tey are capable to lie about many things to avoid the prison. Secondly, the defectant can have criminal record in past, so with having access to accused's background the point about this could help in researching the dicision of the case. For this part, is also possible to mention than criminal persons could intentionally go to the prison for some common case such as steeling somebody's property, to avoid of punishment of anything more serious and horrible like murdering or unlegal human trafickking. and in thhis moment the defectant's past is mostly important than ever! Anothe reason why I agree with a jury should be given all the past facts are cases when the accused peron where slandered and because of missing few background details an innocent man might be convicted. In other words, in reason of unawarenes can interfere with judgement. On the other hand, any personal problems cannot be presented as strong argument for acquittal of a crime. In conclusion, having no access to the accused person's past facts is a big problem. Personally, I support the idea th change practice in a law and jury for them to should be given all the background information to prevent wrong researching their dicision about any case."}
{"text": "Raising the price of car fuel is believed by some people to be an excellent method to solve the growing number of environmental issues. However, I strongly disagree with this idea, as doing so would make life difficult for lower-income households. While making fuel more expensive wouldn’t change the habits of wealthy families, switching to fossil fuel alternatives could prove to be much more beneficial for the environment.The most compelling reason against raising the cost of fuel is that the upper classes of society will hardly be affected by rising fuel costs, as this only makes up a minor proportion of their expenditure. They will continue to use their personal vehicles as they wish without a thought for the environment or the higher fuel prices, even if their country has state-of-the-art public transportation.Those who will feel the crunch of this decision are the middle-class and lower-income households, since travelling is a major part of most people’s routine, be it to work, school or shopping. Driving is almost unavoidable in many instances; therefore, raising the price of petrol would only serve to widen the gap between the rich and poor, and serve as an inadvertent form of discrimination.Another reason why increasing the cost of fuel is far from the best way to deal with environmental pollution is that now there are much more viable alternatives. Due to the rapid advances in technology, scientists and engineers have been able to develop several alternatives to fossil fuel, such as cars powered by electricity or naturally produced biofuel. The move to adopt clean energy sources instead of fossil fuels is a much more promising alternative compared to simply making fuel more expensive.In conclusion, I believe that governments of the world should invest more time and money in finding alternatives to fossil fuels that are more environmentally friendly, rather than simply raising the cost of petrol."}
{"text": ", organization and companies as well as governments impose restrictions in work places and public amenities. It has become fashionable in the world today . I feel that smoking can be harmful, but I don’t think it should be forbidden completely. I would also argue that people should have the whether or not they should smoke.Allow me to present the three positive sides of smoking. Firstly, smoking certainly helps many people to relax. For some, it even improves concentration. If someone is upset or they have , to smoke to reduce the pressure or tension. people like to smoke when they are relaxing with friends. Secondly, governments throughout the world make huge profits from taxes on cigarettes. The income obtained through taxes provides funds which are used for building and public places such as parks, gardens, sports ground and foot paths. Thirdly, tobacco industry also employs tens of thousands of people all over the world, particularly in poorer countries such as Zimbabwe or the Philippines. Without cigarettes, these people would have no jobs.Despite these positive are lots of negative effects to smoking too. Initially, smoking has been proven to be very dangerous for health. cigarette contains more than 4000 chemical substances, therefore, it dangerous diseases such as heart attacks, asthma, bronchitis or lung cancer. According to a recent report in Britain close to 3,500 people are killed each year in road accidents and 120,000 are killed by smoking. Furthermore, smoking costs governments millions of dollars because of the large number of people who need treatment in hospitals for smoking-related problems. Moreover, passive smoking is also a major concern today. Recent research shows that non-smokers can suffer from health problems if they spend long periods of time among people who do smoke. In the UK children whose parents are are three times as likely to start smoking themselves .In short, I think the world would be a better place without cigarettes. However, the decision of whether smoke or not to smoke should be for each individual to make. I suggest that people should not smoke in a room or a place where there are non smokers, however they should be free to smoke elsewhere."}
{"text": "A trend has emerged in the last two decades with youngsters watching more TV than ever before. One of the main reasons behind this issue is the recent advancements in technology in gaming and film industries. This tendency has both pros and cons, and will be further discussed in this essay.The latest developments in video game consoles attracted both children and adults to spend extra time watching TV, compared to the past. With interactive gaming characters and high quality graphics, children are more likely to spend long hours playing games in front of the TV. A recent survey showed that TV addiction among young people, for example, has significantly increased from 5% to 80%, which was supposedly caused by the introduction of advanced gaming consoles. This increase is also partially due to films, drama series and cartoons being easily available on pirated websites and various gaming platforms.This trend has had more negative than positive effects on young citizens. More time spent watching TV adversely affects the mental and physical wellbeing of a child. For instance, the obesity ratio among young individuals in the past 10 years has risen dramatically; this has caused further health problems such as anxiety and depression. However, TV can also be used in a positive way. It is a great source of information that can help youngsters increase their knowledge and succeed in their future careers.In conclusion, recent breakthroughs in technology are driving up the amount of time our youngsters are spending in front of their TV screens. This can do more harm than good if we don’t regulate the use of TV, but parents have the power to make TV time useful and beneficial for their children."}
{"text": "Some countries and culture already utilize insects as part of food source. As such, it can be relatively inexpensive to consume insects - which are often freely found in certain environments and do not take much skill to be collected, killed and consumed - as compared to the cost and manual labor involved in raising animal livestock, butchering, as well as preparing the meat for consumption. Similarly agriculture also involves consistent manual labor, and has costs associated with it, including for machinery and materials needed. However, people may be against the idea of consuming insects due to the novelty of it, and they may also feel disgust around it. As the prompt states, some may find it unhealthy. Harvesting insects on purpose will also require some physical and psychological work - but the benefit here is that it may be easier than harvesting large animals or cultivating crops. I have never consumed an insect product - and my father has mentioned to me that had lived in such-and-such country, I would not be so scared of cockroaches - viewing them as a food source. He intended this to be an ironic comment, meant to comfor me somewhat due to my strong aversion to cockroaches. However, he may be correct! For individuals socialized in such a society, their aversion to roaches may be lower than mine. Hence, part of the issue here is socialization and accepting this new food norm, should it be novel to the individual and/or the country. I have tried an octopus for the first time when I was around 20 years old - as I was curious about this dish called Takoyaki, and had heard good reviews of it. It was not unpleasant to eat the ocotpus, per se, but I likely will not go back to it. All in all, new experiences, including consumption of new types of food, may create strong aversion at first, but once dip your toes into it, so to speak, it may be tamer than the experience you were expecting - even if you never go back to eating it again."}

{"text": "In recent years, the advancement of cutting-edge technology has been elevating the quality of life of customers worldwide. However, the issue at hand is, some consumers face difficulties in choosing products from companies because there are surging numbers of advertisements from rival companies. This essay will examine the extent to where customers are impacted by advertisements and suggest viable methods to protect customers. To begin with, I think that customers are significantly influenced by advertisements viewed to the highest extent because their emotional decision-making as buyers are affected. Although some consumers believe that watching a Mcdonald advertisement on tv does not neccesarily encourage them to purchase foods from Mcdonalds, continously watching Mcdonald advetisements in a repetitive manner will subconsciously revert the customer's attention to order foods from Mcdonalds when they are hungry during late nights. In 2016, a study from Harvard University by Professor Oak mentioned that 75% of consumers who view the same imageries of advertising will began implementing it as a part of their lives. As a result, they become obese. Another point worth mentioning is, rival companies will tend to create an illusion of trust towards their products. If a loyal Colgate customer, a toothpaste brand, was convinced by Oral B through advertisements, another toothpaste brand that their product was better, they will potentially choose Oral B and rely on it permanently despite the fact that they have more flaws in their product. Hence, the customers will become emotionally manipulated. On the contrary, there are a number of profound methodology to prevent increasing numbers of advertisements from influencing customers. One of the most notable ones is, the government should limit the number of advertisements published. Although an advertising company may lose attention from customers due to lack of the marketing, many customers will be able to focus on lesser advertisements that wastes significantly less of their time. Therefore, they will be able to enjoy more time watching the movie or series that they love. Moreover, another important solution that the government should investigate advertisement products displayed online. For instance, in some countries, baby milk powder was replaced with dangerous chemicals that resulted in food poisoning in babies. This caused severe trauma to consumers that re mianly family members worldwide. By implementing stricter control towards advertisement products, customers will be able to reap the rewards of the best products and move on with their life. Yales University states that by enhancing the quality of advertising campaigns despite the rivalry betweem companies, customers will be able to protect themselves from manipulation from marketing schemes. Therefore, customers will be safe from misleading products. In conclusion, while I believe that consumers are significantly influenced by advertisements viewed to the highest extent and create an illusion of trust towards their products, there are also viable measures to protect customers such as the government limiting the number of advertisements shown and investigating advertisement products displayed online."}
{"text": "Improving technology is the tendency of the era right now. Information technology is one type that has already changed a lot from the past. Information technology influences our daily life in many areas, such as home, leisure, and work activities. It positively affects human life, but it also has its disadvantage. I will give my opinion about how information technology influences our lives and the information technology has more benefit or cause more detriment. Information technology improves human life in many different areas. First, it reduces the difficulty of communication. The technology we have right now gives us a faster and easier way to communicate with other who is far from us. Right now, whether we use social media or email, we can contact the people who are far from us immediately. The second part is information gathering; right now, we can get news everywhere, just on electronics, such as cell phones and TV. Also, information technology helps humans in information storage and process. This is the advantage of information technology. Information technology significantly improves human life, but it also has some disadvantages. The first thing is to reduce the time people commute together face by face. Nowadays, classes, meetings, and work can all go online. As a result, we have less chance to meet and communicate; this reduces the ability to watch others' behavior and expression to speculate their feeling and emotion. The second disadvantage is that convenient technology lets people rely on it too much and reduces our ability to finish jobs without technology. In my opinion, the advantage of information technology has way more influence on human life than the disadvantages. First, it helps us solve our problems with more accessible and faster information. This meets the fast rhythm of life in this era. Also, information technology may let people rely on it, but this is very general for humans because we always use anything we can use to solve problems quicker and more efficiently. This is how information technology influences our life."}
{"text": "In many countries around the world, boys and girls are educated together. There is a group of countries, however, that educate boys and girls separately. This is frequently done on religious grounds, but not always. Having such a system can produce various advantages and disadvantages.One of the principal reasons for educating boys and girls separately is that, if they are together, they can distract each other. After puberty, boys can be strongly attracted to girls and vice versa, and this can result in disruptive conduct in the classroom as, for example, they show off to one another. Separating boys and girls can therefore have the distinct advantage of reducing this disturbing behaviour. However, some teachers have pointed out that this model does not always work, and that separated boys and girls are equally disruptive in class, and sometimes more so. These teachers say that having the opposite sex in the classroom can actually improve behaviour.Many educators also believe that boys and girls have different learning styles and needs. Separating boys and girls can allow teachers to address these needs more easily. There is also a belief that single sex schools allow gender stereotypes to be challenged and therefore education aspirations can be broadened.A major disadvantage of separating boys and girls in education is that the children miss important formative behavioural development when they do not have interaction with the other gender on a regular basis. This can lead to shyness and, more seriously, dysfunctional relationships later in life. Some people also feel that mixed sex schools can promote gender stereotypes rather than reducing them.In conclusion, I feel that children should be educated all together, although I would respect a system in which they are separated due to religious beliefs. My personal opinion is that different genders should learn to interact together from an early age, as this would allow them to develop healthy working relationships with each other."}
{"text": "It is a sad fact that criminals who leave prison go on to commit further crime. There are various reasons for this, but there are also some things that can be done to prevent it from happening.One reason for this recidivism is due to a lack of legitimate income. Many people turn to crime as they cannot find an alternative to earn money. When such person comes out of prison, it is very often the case that they have the same few opportunities for a legitimate income. In fact, these opportunities will even be reduced, as employers are often less willing to give an ex-prisoner a job. Some people also return to crime, as they spend all the time of their prison sentence with other criminals. This is not a great environment for rehabilitation, and sometimes even a network of contacts can be made to help develop criminal activities on release.One important way to help address this problem is education. Criminals who have turned to illegal activities because of no alternatives to earn a living need to learn a way to earn a wage, such as a trade or vocational skills. Computer skills, for example, are in high demand and someone trained in these could very possibly find work. In addition, governments can offer incentives to employers to attract them to give jobs to newly-released prisoners. This would help people who don’t really want to return to crime achieve a fresh start. As keeping people in prison is an expensive business, governments might find it cheaper to pay these incentives.To sum up, people returning to crime is a tragedy that should be avoided if at all possible in today’s society. Education and incentives can directly address the reasons for it and could make society a happier and safer place."}
{"text": "There are people who believe that the mixture of nationalities make faster the development of a country. Although, it could seem that an international environment could influence negatively the culture of a country, I believe that the exchange that is born from people coming from different places is essential in order to develop the social attitudes of the citiziens and to have new ideas and perspectives. The internationality of a country permits people to develop their social attitudes. To live in the same country with people who have originated in a different one require all of them to be open to discover now personal outlooks. They have to communicate between each other and also to respect the different cultural habits they have. This lead people to be more open-minded and ready to accept new changes. A country in which there are these features will develop from different point of view faster. Indeed, people will be already able to understand the flow of the new trends and they will be open to new economical and political choices. By contrast, in a country in which there is no way to interact with people who have a different nationality will be more difficult to understand the limit and the possibilities of their country. Although the tradition of the country will be preserved, people will be less accostumated to the change trying to mantain their traditional custums, even if uncorrect, as soon as they can. The political and economical assestment of these country will reflect the closeness of the population. For instance, they will be less concerned about the stability of the other countries and they will try to develop their own without caring of the international consequences. Furthermore, a country in which there are different people who comes from different places is one in which new ideas and perspectives can be develped. Indeed, workplaces will be encouraged in their development by the interaction between people who have different culture. In the general picture, the benefit of each single and small company will impact positively on the country itself and its economical status. To go further, people who have to interact with other foreign nationalities will be able to communicate with them and this means that they will be able to speak and understand other languages other than their mother tongue. The ability to be fluently in other languages, mostly in English, nowadays is essential for the develop of a country. The companies will be able to expand their trade. In conclusion, I completely agree with the idea that a country can develop faster its population is made of different nationalities. There will be advantages from the social and cultural perspective as well as from the economical and political point of view."}
{"text": "Punishing children with physical force, or corporal punishment as it is also called, is something that was accepted not so long ago and people over the age of forty may well remember it. Nowadays, however, corporal punishment is against the law in most countries and adults who practise it can be taken to court. Children are always a vulnerable group and they depend on adults for protection and education. Of course, part of the growing up process is testing and breaking boundaries and it is nearly always necessary to instill discipline on a child. Whether or not it is necessary to use physical force to do so can be a very emotive subject.Supporters of corporal punishment often defend their standpoint by explaining that the corporal punishment is not, or should not be, excessive. They do not argue that a child should be beaten severely until he or she is bruised or cut. They argue that just the infliction of mild pain causes effective discipline and also the fear that it might be applied. People who grew up experiencing it might offer this point of view.Those who oppose using physical force on a child would say that the vulnerability and innocence of a child means that force should never be used. Children need to trust adults and believe that no harm will come to them. Additionally, children learn from adults and it is argued that corporal punishment will only teach children that force is an answer to various problems. It is also claimed that corporal punishment has no added benefits over other forms of discipline that do not require physical force. Using it can cause psychological harm to children and should be classed as child abuse.Personally, I do not believe that limited use of forms of corporal punishment can cause harm, and a parent who administers a mild form of it to his or her child should not be subject to criminal proceedings. Nevertheless, I would not use it myself. I can also recognise the possibilities of adults who are not a child’s parents misusing corporal punishment. Therefore, I believe that on balance physical force to discipline children should not be permitted."}
{"text": "As society becomes more and more saturated with technology, traditional cultures are losing their roles in society. The compatibility of technology and traditions are often debated where some suggest it is possible, whereas, others argue it is not. In this essay, I will discuss both perspectives and conclude by saying how and why it is almost impossible. Since people usually appreciate limited ways of living, it is challenging for both conventions and technology to co-exist. They will usually choose one method or another but not both at the same time. For instance, a company would have to focus on using human labour or advanced machineries to produce a product. The incompatibility may not be obvious at first but as technology develops futher, use of machines will increase but employment will decrease. Furthermore, technology is often considered to be more convenient and faster by many people. Work can be done more efficiently so workers will start to abandon the old ways of living or working. In contrast, it might be possible for two values to work along in society due to different tastes of various people. Traditional cultures are usually appreciated by old generation such as grandparents, meanwhile, new generation prefers technology in their life. For example, grandparents can read newspaper while grandchildren watch TV or play games during family time. Moreover, although it is hard for a company to use both at the same time, it is not totally impossible. If the number of machines is controlled during production, human labour and machines can work together to maximise productivity by covering up each other's disadvantages. All in all, even though traditional values and technology can be compatible theoratically, it is indeed difficult to compromise the use between two in real life. Ergo, people would have to beware of the risk of losing traditional cultures, if at all."}
{"text": "If one wants to work for money, there are really only two options, working for someone else for a salary and being self-employed. Most people are involved with these two options and they both have advantages and disadvantages.Being self-employed means that the worker owns the business that is being done. This might be a small one-person business or a large company with hundreds of employees. The first advantage of this is the capacity to earn more money. If the business does very well, the income can be considerable and the owner of the company will receive the benefits. On the other hand, if business is not good, the owner’s income will be low. Self-employed people also have the benefit to some extent of choosing their working hours and holidays and they have the right to change anything within their business. With this autonomy, however, comes the pressure to succeed and the reliance on one’s employees, if there are any, to do their best to make the business thrive.Salaried workers do not experience the same stress as the self-employed owners of companies. They might have stress in their duties, but the pressure that comes with keeping one’s own business operating successfully in order to support oneself and one’s family is just not felt by an employee. The employee also has a certain knowledge of his or her income, as the salary is usually fixed every month. The self-employed owner’s income often depends on how successful the business is. The employee’s fixed income, however, does not give much scope for earning large amounts more. In addition, an employee does not have the freedoms of the owner or the autonomy, and for many people, having control over their lives is a significant factor to their well-being.It is certain that there are advantages and disadvantages for both being self-employed and salaried. I personally disagree that being salaried is better than being self-employed. I prefer the autonomy that being self-employed brings and, although there is more risk and pressure, this can lead to greater and more fulfilling rewards."}

{"text": "In recent years, improvement and immense expansion of supermarkets, including convenience stores often takes place of the local business. Some people are concerned that their own local businesses will be taken by large companies. Although it is understandable to feel scared, and anxious, I disagree with this idea. People always need to adjust the issue flexibly. I would like to share examples and ideas in Japanese society. To begin with, the majority of society is based on capitalist society. This means that people who run their own businesses are always competitive with competitors. This means that large companies are more beneficial to provide more convenient and high-quality services with affordable finance and ideas. For example, Japanese convenience stores are monopolized by three companies. These companies' stores are ubiquitous around Japan and they provide literary convenient services. Customers can buy magazines, underwear, and some special products, such as instant noodles which are featured by famous noodle restaurants. Customers can always buy the same products around Japan. Therefore, it must be difficult for local convenience stores to fight against large companies. Secondly, this phenomenon is not necessarily cause a negative effect on local businesses and communities. As I mentioned above, it will cause more convenient to local people. Furthermore, the people who used to run the local convenience store will be able to run the large companies' convenience stores as franchised stores by taking advantage of their own experience. Furthermore, running some stores and companies, instead of running only one company is getting standard for entrepreneurs because they can prepare for the fast-paced society. The more they can constantly increase their profit , the more options have on whether they should compensate for a deficit sales figure in a store or company. Furthermore, they can just terminate the company and focus on the profitable company. By doing this process, they can survive in the competitive society. In conclusion, it is unpredictable which industries and services suddenly emerge and take place of their own business. Therefore, people always need to keep up with this fast-paced society."}
{"text": "In recent years, more people tend to move to big cities from the countryside has been increasing extremely, especially developed countries, including Japan. Therefore, the total population in the country seems to be not changed, but the balance of the population has been widening in a few decades. I would like to share some example in Japan and suggest ideas to reverse its population in the countryside. Mainly, job opportunities in the big cities are much higher than in the countryside. The majority of companies and foreign company branches tend to be located in Tokyo, and Osaka. Therefore, people need to move to the big cities or suburbs area to get their jobs. This means that real estate, house, and apartment prices have been soaring drastically. Moreover, the phenomenon connects to the prices rise up in a variety of industries. For example, the food prices in the restaurants need to raise due to monthly tenants payment has been surging. Therefore, people can easily get or change their job in big cities, it is not necessarily wealthy. Nevertheless, ironically, since Covid-19 widely spread worldwide, many companies launched remote work. Even now, the majority of people do not need to commute to the office. In addition, some companies declare that they never change the working system in the future, because they have already systemized the IT system which is able to work remotely. Therefore, this is a great chance for the Japanese government to dissipate the population in local cities. If people start to move to local cities or countryside, the population in the local cities or countryside increased. It will be not only helpful for people to live there with reasonable prices, but also for effective economic growth in the local cities and countryside. In addition, the local governments will be able to organize the infrastructure, roads, medical care, and education. As a result, the quality of the infrastructure will be close to the big cities. Finally, if the government financially supported this remote working system to companies, the above phenomenon will be available. As a result, the disparity of wealth will not be wider, and people will be able to get job opportunities with living in the countryside."}
{"text": "An alarming number of people today consume sugar-based drinks, whether it is in the form of soda, energy drinks or fruit drinks. Often consumers are lured by their widespread availability and convenience, however, marketing campaigns also play a role, targeting young people and giving them the perception that sugary drinks are not as unhealthy as they actually are.The availability of these types of drinks has greatly increased over time. They can now be found in almost any store or restaurant, which makes them easily accessible to almost anyone. The fact that they are often cheaper than alternatives, such as water or freshly squeezed juice, makes them an especially attractive option for those on a budget. Marketing campaigns for sugary beverages have been quite successful in creating positive associations attached to these products through advertisements on TV and billboards. This encourages people to consider them fun rather than unhealthy and normalises them within society.Luckily, reversing the rise in popularity of sugary drinks is still possible, if we act now and attack the problem from different angles. One of the very first steps should be educating people on the health risks associated with high sugar intake so that they can make better-informed decisions when selecting what type of beverage they consume. Companies should also be held accountable by law for their misleading marketing campaigns aimed at children and teenagers who are more likely to believe the false claims about their products’ health benefits without fully understanding what’s being sold to them. Schools, colleges and universities, and any institutions catering for young people, should consider banning sugary drinks and replacing them with refreshing alternatives without added sugar.Overall, it is important that we recognise the potential health risks posed by consuming too much sugar from soft drinks and take actionable steps towards reversing this trend in order to ensure our long-term wellbeing. Through greater education, government regulation, and increased corporate responsibility we can ensure that more people understand why reducing their intake of sugary beverages is important while still allowing them to access enjoyable yet healthier options."}
{"text": "Boxing is really dangerous sport which usually leads to physical injuries. However, I do not agree that it is inappropriate for the modern age to has such a sport, since it is a huge part of our culture and many people actually enjoy watching it. To begin with, boxing is depicted as blood but fair and honorable sport in different kinds of art, such as literature and cinema. For instance, Ernest Hemingway has a number of stories related to this sport in his book Men Without Women, and there are also various movies about boxing. A one may become boxer for different reasons: it could be encouraged by existing culture, it could be a wish to fight fairly without any lie which is rarely achievable in life outside sport, or a way to throw out internal aggression. In any way, it is his or her freedom of choise whether to take part in this sport or not, and I believe it is absolutely not appropriate to forbid people boxing. Furthermore, people actually like watching boxing, otherwise it would not be so popular. They associate themselves with a sportsman and experience rush and adrenaline along with him. After a competetion, fans usually feel relief as after great movie, except they know that all the action took place in real life, which is not a case for movies. This perception of reality increases the feelings greatly, leading to more fascinating experience. In the end, I want to underline this again: I believe that boxing is totally appropriete for the modern world, along with other extreme sports, and its cancellation would be absolutely unfair and generally bad, even though it is undisputably very injury-prone."}
{"text": "While some people argue that equal numbers of male and female students should be accepted in every major, I personally disagree with this statement. There are a number of arguments that can support my stance. To begin with, it is impossible to enroll equal genders of students in every subject. It is true that some faculties are underrepresented by a particular gender. For example, STEM subjects usually have more male students than females, but the opposite is true in educational-related subjects, which phenomenon seems to violate the principle that we fight endeavor today, gender equality. Therefore, people want to accept equal numbers of students to achieve a gender balance in every subject. However, the reality is that different genders prefer to study different subjects themselves, but not because of the unequal opportunity. According to one of the research, women show a higher interest in subjects like education, psychology and arts rather than science-related subjects. As a result, it is apparent that admitting equivalent proportions of male and female students can hardly be achieved. In addition, it will deprive students of chances to make their own choices if universities enroll both genders equally in every subject mandatorily. It should be noted that it is students' right to select the subjects freely in college. If students cannot register for the subjects they want to study just because there are not enough quotas left for particular gender of students, or they are forced to study some subjects they are not interested in just because they need to fulfill the gender requirement in the class, it will hinder students' learning in the long-run. To conclude, universities should not enroll equal gender students in every subject as it is impossible to achieve and may deprive students the freedom to choose the major they want to study."}
{"text": "There are many ways to learn new knowledge and skills. Traditional educational routes, such as school followed by college or university is one route that is generally accepted and respected by today’s society. It can be argued, however, that this is not always the best way. A more vocational route can be more appropriate for certain people and for particular jobs.Universities generally have deference given to them and, due to this, most schools tailor their programs to help students get university admission. Universities usually have respected and highly qualified teachers who have the knowledge and the skills to take their students to very high levels of knowledge and expertise. The very difficulty of gaining admission, getting through the duration of the course and passing final exams ensures to employers that graduates have the necessary self-discipline, intelligence and ability to get through the courses.Universities are also particularly well suited to the teaching of various subjects, for example, medicine, law and literature and these subjects need students’ full-time attention in order to do well. Although vocational experience is necessary, a certain grounding in basic concepts to a high-level is important. Once this knowledge has been acquired, students can then integrate their knowledge with practical understanding.This, however, is not the case for all areas of learning, especially ones where the quantity of high level knowledge is not required or is possible to be learned whilst working at the same time. Young people studying to be an electrician or a plumber are good examples. To do this work well requires a lot of experience, yet also a sound understanding of theory. The learning here can be and is done working and studying at the same time, often through apprenticeships and vocational courses involving significant amounts of work experience.Therefore, in my opinion, there are more ways than one to acquire a profession. Whether learning should take place at university alone or whilst working depends on the course and the end job."}
{"text": "There are many factors to encourage the quality of societies, some people believe that competitiveness is the main factor to improve communities. The following essay will focus on importance of competitiveness on individuals and cite my opinion which believe that it is a positive trend to develop societies. First of all, if you want to improve a skill of an individual in the differnet aspects of life like sport, you should play him with higher level to develop his talent and get best of him. For example ,a famous tennis table player from my town said in an interview, that he improved his talent when he played against his older brother, he was working hard in training sessions to reach the higher level, the standard that his brother plays in order to beat him and win games. The competetion between him and his brother lift up his skills and strenthgen his mentality. secondly, competitions may create good atmosphere and healthy climate for children to improve thier abilitie in study. For example, my daughter and her friends in the class were struggling in studying math, the math teacher found a way to make the math more interesting for students, the teacher announced for a competition every day at the end of lesson, she writes an equations on the board and gives prizes for students who can solve them. Nowadays, my daughter is enjoying to solve math problems. Furthermore, competitions can improve people's career, and increase company's outcome, some managers tend to encourage competitiveness between employers to have more benefits for company and workers as well. To conclude, competitiveness enables people to improve their talents and students to love what they study, also employers will develop their skills, as a result of that most societies will get more benefits of this trend."}
{"text": "According to COVID-19 event forced many company to change their way of working. One of the most significant transformation is the communication. The online communication becomes a must or inevitable for the company to be implemented. In this topic, we're going to disscuss the advantages and disadvantages for both ways of communications. The online meeting can introduce a significant impact to the organization while face to face meeting can be outdated for this new era of 2021. First of all for the online communication's advantages is that in the pandemic period the actual physical contact is a significant way to transmit the disease. Video conference can help mitigate this problem by lower the physical contact for each conversation or meeting. Also communicates through online channel can help individual to organize or manage their time efficiently according to each person preference. For example, a single mom parent may be able to spend times for her sons/daughters at home, while be able to have a cross country meeting with another department in other region. Another reason is that some people are quite introvert and find it difficult for face to face human interactions or conversations, in which online chat or messages can help them to mitigate this problem and communicate efficiently. Lastly as mentioned about video conference across region, online meeting can help the multi-national corporates save the transporations cost and additional resources needed to spend for face to face meeting. For the disadvantages, all of the online communications required hardware, internet connection and technological knowledge on how to use them. This technological gap can be seen as one of the most significant obstracle or disadvantage for people to use online communications. For example, in one company, there obviously have a various age of people, in which some of them are not familiar with the technology. Since video call conference has been introduced and utilized widespread among corporates not so long time ago. This can be a big technological gap for some people to use the online communications and result in a lost in communications among the workplaces. As a result, online communication helps an organization to reduce the risk of transmitting the disease, improved the time mangement ability and productivity for each individuals, and lower the financial cost or resources required to spends for international business activities. With all these advantages of online communication stated, they can be seens as a significant reasons to outweight the disadvantages of technological gap on this current year of 2021."}
{"text": "In the past decades, there was a rapid increase in the use of road traffic in cities over the world as cities sprawl where cars become essential while transit, bicycling and walking become less practical. Commuting from home to work, shopping and going to school from place to place account for a higher sheer volume of traffic in the cities that is causing a thousand hundreds of problems, consisting of traffic jams and air pollution. Some people believe there is an enormous improvement in road traffic if the travelling needs for people across the cities are deducted. The governments play a vital role to figure out this issues. There is no doubt that cities have spread out over larger expanses of land as builders have construced wide expressways and ample parking to accomodate motor vehicles. This tempts a large surge in car use and public transit use has fallen. A case in point is Los Angeles where traffic jams are a part of living. According to a survey in 2016, Los Angeles drivers spent an average of 104 peak drive-time hours fighting slow traffic. Michael G McNally, a professor at the University of California claimed that the poor public transit services was one key of factors in the congestion incident on the road of Los Angeles. This forces people to drive their cars to travel from place to place as there is no option to be chosen. However, improving public transport facilities alone is rarely considered enough to cope with the high volume in usage of the road traffic as the demand is still there. In recent years, the number of suburban hypermarkets ballooned in the cities, particularly in the developed countries, due to the high land cost in metropoils. Thereby, the amount of road traffic is sharply escalated in cities since people can drive their cars from home town to suburban or their destination. LA had an estimated 7.8 million registrations in population of 10 million in 2016 when New york just had 3.6 million registrations in population of 8.5 million. Car owners accounted for nearly 80% of population in L.A. This is highly likely that the car ownership is an vital reason for the busy road traffic. Reduction in numbers of car ownership is definitly one solution in the traffic congestion. By adopting policies to increase the car registration fee and to rise the parking cost, government can take one important step towards solving this problems. My own view is that the travelling needs from place to place continuously increase in line with the development of metropolis. The high cost of parking and car registration fee combined with the 24-hour public transit system in cities can effectively limit the number of car ownership. This is a direct impact on the volume of road traffic over the cities."}
{"text": "Some believe that people should not continue to work once they reach the age of retirement. Do you agree or disagree? Give reasons for your answer and include relevant examples from your experience.In recent years, with the improvement in healthcare sector and better , people are able to live longer and contribute to the economic progress of a nation more, compared to the past. Some see this as an entirely positive development, while others point out the drawbacks of working beyond the retirement age.Delaying retirement enables individuals to actively contribute to the society. On a personal level, working past retirement age provides an avenue for individuals to remain not only physically but also mentally active. Moreover, this option empowers the ageing population to be financially independent and economically self-sustainable past retirement age. In countries with growing ageing population such as Singapore, for instance, citizens are given an option to work beyond their retirement age based on the demands of their job and their capability to handle these tasks. Hence, working beyond retirement age empowers workers, ensures economic progression of the nation, and alleviates the challenges faced by an ageing population.On the flip side, working beyond the retirement age may result in adverse health impacts on workers and a decrease in productivity levels. In Japan, the suicide rates have recently been increasing due to rising stress levels at work faced by the ageing population who are pushed to work beyond their optimal capacity. Escalating stress levels from work to various health complications putting a strain on the healthcare system. Hence, working beyond retirement age may worsen the overall welfare of individuals and adversely impact the economy.To sum up, though working beyond retirement age health hazards leading to reduction in productivity levels, it seems to me that the benefits far outweigh the disadvantages. In my opinion, by assessing the capability of individuals and tailoring their jobs to their health profile, firms and companies should actively involve their workers to be productive beyond their retirement age."}

{"text": "It indeed appears true that the frequency with which advertisements for charities appear both on television and the Internet seems to be increasing. There can be various explanations for this and it can be seen in both a positive and negative light.One explanation for the increase in the number of charity advertisements is that the charities themselves are becoming more aggressive in their marketing. This can also be seen in the common strategy nowadays to encourage a monthly donation, rather than a one-off donation. The increased marketing is apparent too in the increased numbers of ‘street salespeople’, who stop passersby and try to get them to commit to this monthly payment.A second reason for the increase could also be that there have been more charities started and the number of advertisements would therefore increase and become more noticeable. If these charities are all legitimate, this would mean that more help will be getting to causes that need it. The increase in charities could also be explained by a possible increase of humanitarian awareness. People might be now adopting different ideologies that take into account people in less advantageous positions.If the number of advertisements for charities has risen due to the fact that there has been a positive shift in people’s compassionate principles, this surely has to be seen as an optimistic development. If it is due to the fact that governments have been cutting back, it could be seen as a pessimistic development. In addition, if there are more charities asking for more money, this will inevitably mean that the amount of money donated will have to be more thinly spread, which would be a negative development.There could be several reasons for why there are more charity advertisements today. Whatever the reasons, as long as any money is helping people in disadvantageous positions, it must be seen as a positive development."}
{"text": "It is undeniable that crime inevitably contributes to negative consequences to society, which affects in various aspects. Hence, there is a belief that giving longer prison sentences could be the most effective way to reduce the crime rate. Nevertheless, there are also opponents who believe that other effective mitigations are also available which I personally agree with. It is true that being sentenced for a very long period is what people do not want to experience. A criticism in favor of this is that those who live in prison will lack freedom. This is because prisoners will be forced to stay in jail only, meaning that they could not meet their companions as well as traveling to another country until the end of the prison term. Another common example which supports the idea of increasing the sentence term is that prisoners will be under control by authorities all time. Living in this condition would possibly result in the loss of privacy, which is the experience that people tend to avoid. In spite of the fact that giving longer sentences seems to be effective, other solutions could also be applied. A classic example is that people who break the laws must pay an extremely high penalty to governments. Since people do not want to lose their money, this policy is likely to encourage people to follow the laws, leading to the declining number of crime. Another potential solution could be done by schools to teach young generations about the effects of crime. Once students understand that committing crime would lead to the lower standard of living of people in communities such as reducing in the neighbors' safety, they tend to behave in the opposite way which is to improve the living conditions of other people instead and this would have hugely positive impacts in the long term. In conclusion, despite the fact that being in prison for a long time is a completely terrible experience for people because of no flexibility and privacy in life, it seems to me that other alternatives which are paying higher fines and educating young people with respect to negative effects of crime tend to be more effective. This is because these solutions are likely to address the root cause of committing crime and tend to be more applicable in the long run."}
{"text": "At present, it is possible to note that families come in different and diverse structures. Overall, these changes occur because of women are entering the work force, which changes the roles of a traditional family. I strongly believe that these changes are positive to society and to the economy. In the following paragraphs I will present my reasons to have such opinion. One major factor that affects family structures is women being allowed to work outside their homes. Within the last century, women joined the work force, modifying the traditional family setting that was compoused by men being the ones who provided for their families. Therefore, the roles changed as both mothers and fathers could financially provide for their children. Moreover, women do not need to rely on their husbands to raise children as they have jobs themselves, and they might even decide to raise a baby by their own, creating a new type of family strucutre that is comprised of only a mother and a child. Furthermore, couples can even decide not to have children at all, and only focus on their carreers, as women have the possibility of being a lot more than mothers. These changes are definitly positive of an economical and societal point of view. Women are now part of the work force, therefore, they contribute for the economy. Besides that, changes in family structures and roles make people more tolerant, as they see that there is no limitation for what a women can do. To summarize, there are indeed several changes occurring in families structures, and the roles people play in it. Women being part of the work force has changed male and female contribution to a family, which has a positive impact, socially and economically speaking."}

First of all, climate change caused by different reasons for example waste production by factories which is released in rivers and oceans. Also carbon monoxide released by cars and other types of transportion. Also, community behiover such as use of plastic and non-recyclabe materils. Secondly, we can as community reduce the effect of climte change on our enviroment by different ways. One of them is taking puplic transportion insted of using our own cars. In the matter of transportion, walking or using bicycles are the best for the climte because there is zero carbon monixide release. Moreover, replace the plastic bags with reusable ones will reduce the amount of waste. In addition, goverments couled set rules and laws to control the amount of waste released in the enviroment. In Addition, planting more trees will have positive impact on the earth since they release more oxygen. Howevere, climte change is unavoidable result of our current actions. If we continue to act in the same ways the earth will be destroyed by the pullution. I beleive goverments and communites coopration could minimize and delay the effect of climte change on the plant earth."}
{"text": "In recent years, improvement and immense expansion of supermarkets, including convenience stores often takes place of the local business. Some people are concerned that their own local businesses will be taken by large companies. Although it is understandable to feel scared, and anxious, I disagree with this idea. People always need to adjust the issue flexibly. I would like to share examples and ideas in Japanese society. To begin with, the majority of society is based on capitalist society. This means that people who run their own businesses are always competitive with competitors. This means that large companies are more beneficial to provide more convenient and high-quality services with affordable finance and ideas. For example, Japanese convenience stores are monopolized by three companies. These companies' stores are ubiquitous around Japan and they provide literary convenient services. Customers can buy magazines, underwear, and some special products, such as instant noodles which are featured by famous noodle restaurants. Customers can always buy the same products around Japan. Therefore, it must be difficult for local convenience stores to fight against large companies. Secondly, this phenomenon is not necessarily cause a negative effect on local businesses and communities. As I mentioned above, it will cause more convenient to local people. Furthermore, the people who used to run the local convenience store will be able to run the large companies' convenience stores as franchised stores by taking advantage of their own experience. Furthermore, running some stores and companies, instead of running only one company is getting standard for entrepreneurs because they can prepare for the fast-paced society. The more they can constantly increase their profit , the more options have on whether they should compensate for a deficit sales figure in a store or company. Furthermore, they can just terminate the company and focus on the profitable company. By doing this process, they can survive in the competitive society. In conclusion, it is unpredictable which industries and services suddenly emerge and take place of their own business. Therefore, people always need to keep up with this fast-paced society. 2004 is the year in which there is less disparity between the score of team B and the other two. Team A in 2004 had totalised 35 point and team B only 8 point more. Even if the points of team C are 1 the overall score's dicrepancy is less than in other year. Indeed, in 2002 there is a huge dicrepancy concerning the scores of the teams. Team B obtained 82 points while the other two teams obtained respectively 5 points (team A) and 10 points (team B)."}

They feel music separates a person from socializing and that it is a form of addiction and distraction.Especially, parents feel that their child's concentration is impacted while multitasking with music and studies.For extroverts its a sort of discomfort or hindrance.Few extroverts feel better to share their feelings and difficulties with others than staying alone and listening to a song.

{"text": "With the development of technology, an increasing number of people try to acquire the latest technology such as computer programming, rather than to study history. There is a debate whether studying histroy could give us more advantages to understand the present society. In my opinion, obtaining knowledge of past history would be definitely helpful for us to live well in society today. I hold this opinion for two reasons, which I will elaborate on in the following essay. To begin with, looking back on history would give us the opportunity to notice mistakes which human beings used to make in the past. Specifically, all kinds of people and countries around the world had made innumerable mistakes throughout history. Besides, some of these mistakes might result in a huge number of victims. Therefore, human beings must avoid these tragedic events happening again. Above all, only knowing history could lead to avoidance of the recurrences. To be more specific, World War must be one of the serious events in human being history, and understanding of this truth have a significant impact on how we should live not to cause war again in the present society. It is manifest that leaning history is meaningful in this regard. On the other hand, some arguments can be made that old stories have little something to do with our present lives. However, closer examination would reveal that all the relationships present today originally come from something in the past. Knowing history enables us to find the best way to a fruitful future. The compelling example of this is racial discrimination in the U.S. Understanding the U.S. history could give us the best manner not to deteriorate relationships in the U.S. I suppose that studying history would be helpful for all human beings from this aspect. Having considered all the arguments above, learning history would be a major contributor to a better understanding of the present because we can know how to avoid the same mistake people used to made and how we should behave for the better result through history."}
{"text": "Some people complain that people who work in the entartaining industry such as film stars, pop musicians or sports stars earn excessively huge ammount of money. I agree with that statement, however, I believe that other more essential proffesionals such as doctors, teachers, rescuers should be highly paid. On the one hand, entertainers earn incredible sum of money which can be estimated much more times than ordinary people obtain. Thier salaries usually allow famous celebrities live very wealthy - they possess expensive properties, laxury cars, have vocations in the best resorts, which a person from another sphere hardly can afford. Of cause, it seems not a matter of the fact that they earn more money than others, but for some people that fact can be observed as unfairness, because the jobs of celebrities are not a rocket of science. However, this is a famous postulate that demand creates supply, that is why demanded professionals have higher earnings than others. For as long as people have possibilities and willingness to make their lives more brighter and interestings, they will pay for entertaining businesses. This is the main reason why entertainers usually wealthy and rich. On the other hand, some proffesionals such as doctors, teacher, rescuers can be recognised like more important than entertainers, nevertheless they usually underpaid or their earnings can be even so little that it is hard to survive for them. I belive that those people play the more essential roles in the skill development, health improvements and safty of life in general. In my opinion, population should pay more attention to those kinds of proffesions. Additionally, governments should support financially such workers from vitaly important idustries. Moreover, those professionals are usually in demand, by that I mean they should be payed as demanded employees, such as entertainers, no less. In conclusion, some professionals such as entertainers are paid extremely more money because they are in demand. However, some professionals, such as doctors, teachers, rescuers, usually underpaid. I belive that people as well as government should reconsider the salaries of workers based on their achievements and importance for a society."}

What is your opinion?Give reasons for your answer and include examples from your experience.Write at least 250 wordsSome argue that dieting has an extraordinary impact on one’s life, whereas others are of a view that it absolutely adversely affects a person’s health. It cannot be denied that dieting taken to extremes may cause more harm than good, however, in my opinion effective dieting is pivotal for maintaining good health and keeping a more attractive body shape.First of all, the possibility of increasing level of physical health lies with incorporating proper dieting in our lives. It is reasonable to suggest that dieting is effective for controlling our body weight within an ideal range in order to achieve the normal score of body mass index (BMI), which is essential for preventing us from overweight or obese. As a result, the risk of suffering an illness will be reduced. A recent research concluded that dieting is one of the most effective measures to cut down one’s body weight among the obese group, and it helps to improve their medical condition indirectly.Moreover, dieting is crucial for keeping ideal body features regardless of gender and age. A fit and presentable body outlook absolutely boosts up one’s level in his or her social life, not to mention professions that require keeping one’s body in an attractive physical shape. For example, dieting is adopted as a popular way for reducing weight among actors and actresses. A recent article reported that an actress who successfully regained her slim body after a period of dieting was offered an excellent job opportunity in the Hollywood film industry.In conclusion, in my opinion dieting has a positive influence on one’s life in terms of maintaining a profound level of health and keeping a more attractive body outlook."}

Portugal was the first European country to end this kind of penalty. Since the 19th century, tolerance and respect for life important values. Moreover, we can affirm that remains under the same codes. Maybe because of a religious view point, the respect for life is a typical value in the Old Catholic world.Those who are in favor of capital punishment mostly live in developing countries. However, this is not just an image of the Third World countries. Actually, the USA is one country where this kind of punishment has its rates of application. The state of Texas, in particular, is at the top, supporting this measure against crime, especially those involving serial killers and crimes against children. In a society dominated by fear and government control, it is foreseen that this penalty will continue .Maybe this is not a simple question. As we can see there are several values here and of course cultural behavior. The roots of the question are religious, cultural, ethical and even geographical. The world is divided and the law systems show this division. The solutions, however can lead us to other questions concerning revenge and justice. better to kill a person because of his crimes? Can we admit that a life sentence could be a much better sentence? In fact, rehabilitation is the right way especially with an accurate psychological evaluation first.

{"text": "To perform well in a job, people have to be motivated. There are multiple strategies for employers to incentivise their employees. The most obvious one is the salary; however, job satisfaction and the ability to help people are other methods of improving performance at work.For the majority of the people, receiving their salary at the end of the month is their motivation. This is because money is necessary to fulfill the most basic needs and other materialistic desires. Employees see these opportunities when receiving their salary and therefore work to achieve money. Furthermore, performing well in a job can often lead to promotions with higher pay packages. To receive this, staff have to stand out positively in their jobs. Salary is therefore a key motivational tool for many workforce participants.However, money is far from being the only incentive. Another aspect affecting performance is job satisfaction. If a person is comfortable in their work, they are more likely to perform well. Therefore this motivational tool interlinks with salary, as when people are content and perform well, the chances of promotion increase. For some individuals though, only their passion can drive them. Prime examples for this are humanitarian jobs. The salaries are often not very high, but those choosing to work in this field are often very driven; their passion to help others is prioritised over their own salary.In conclusion, while income might be the most common motivational factor, it is unusual to be the sole incentive for working hard, and some people are motivated wholly due to other reasons."}
{"text": "There is currently a contentious argument that using English as an international language will always have more benefits than drawbacks. Despite the use of English, which has been spreading globally, has positive effects on communication in various aspects, I personally believe that the disadvantages of the spread of English will eventually be more significant. It is true that when more and more countries use English as a common language, the advantages of this implementation will outweigh its negative consequences. A classic example of this is that people from any country could communicate to each other in the easier way. This is because there will be no language barrier, preventing people to deliver their messages to others. Furthermore, using English globally tend to have less misunderstanding when communicating. This is exemplified by natives who live in the same country and speak the same language. These people can understand what each other say completely. Therefore, in terms of global perspective, if everyone has conversations in English, misleading communication tend to be less occurred. In spite of the aforementioned positive consequences of the growing use of English, there are also potential drawbacks. A common example of this is the missing of some languages. Languages which are only used by small groups of people tend to fade away due to the fact that the majority of people would pay more attention to English without conserving these languages. In addition, nations that do not apply English as an international language tend to have small global economic growth. This is because most countries in international markets can understand English. Hence, countries whose people are unable to apply English could inevitably have less opportunities to make commercial deals with other countries, having the ability to speak English. In conclusion, it is undeniable that the spread of English positively affects the way people from different countries communicate to each other and significantly decreases inaccurate information in conversations. Nevertheless, as this development can lead to the lost in other languages and the declining economy of some countries, I totally disagree with the notion that the advantages of the increasing popularity of English will continue to outweigh the disadvantages. This is because I personally think that the aforementioned negative impacts are the two most crucial aspects when using English."}
{"text": "Extreme sports, such as mountain climbing and hand-gliding, have become increasingly popular over the past several decades. Now more than ever, athletes can be paid to do these activities full-time, encouraging more aspiring athletes to enter extreme sports. In addition, the addictive nature of these activities means that participants tend to stay in the sport for the thrill. While the increased popularity can result in more accidents, it can also make the sports safer as atheletes collectively learn from past mistakes. While people have undertaken extreme activities long before the advent of television and social media, these new platforms give extreme sports the much needed sponsorship and attention. Nowadays, outlandish and dangerous acts can be televised and monetized, giving the athletes a way to make a living out of these events. Therefore, more people would feel encouraged to participate in these activities knowing that they can have a decent income. On top of the external motivation, most extreme athletes take part in these sports because they are thrilling and addicting. These atheletes chase the rush and validation that they get when doing dangerous activities. As a result, even without the external rewards, some people would still partake in these sports. Given that people are motivated both internally and externally to participate in extreme sports, it is inevitable that these activities become more popular. While it is true that increased participation would result in more accidents, it would also create more lessons for future participants. In this way, these accidents and injuries would help educate future athletes on how to protect themselves. Moreoever, this increased popularity would also encourage governments to draft more safety regulations. In conclusion, given that it is human nature to want to achieve feats of strength and courage, extreme sports would always be attractive for some. Because of this, there will always be people injuring themselves while pursuing these feats. Therefore, these activities would become safer the more athletes learn from past incidents."}
{"text": "Some people strongly blame that the government does not control the rise in obesity in children. Although the government needs to take responsibility to some extent, I disagree with this idea. Firstly, people need to consider, who needs to take responsibility for raising children. It is obviously their parents. This means that if parents gave well controlled, and balanced nutritious food to children, it would be possible to prevent the rise in obesity. Therefore, parents need to consider their children's health as a top priority, instead of criticizing the government. Therefore, parents first need to master cooking. On the other hand, some countries face a high percentage of obesity in children is higher than in other developed countries. This means that some food that contains too much sugar might be sold cheaper than healthy food, vegetable, chicken, fish, and so on. Therefore, parents who are suffering from poverty tend to choose cheaper, and unhealthy food. This is understandable that governments need to control the prices between healthy food and too much sugar and fat contained food. Finally, in my opinion, however, some food contains too much sugar, fat, and too high calories are cheaper, so parents need to consider their children's health as the first priority. Although the government controlled the food prices between unhealthy food and wholesome food, the parents continued choosing unhealthy food and never cooked meals, and the rise in obesity in children remains the same. Therefore, the most important point is parents need to educate themselves about nutrition and observe their children's diet. If they learned and made some effort to provide healthy food to children, the percentage of obesity will drastically drop."}
{"text": "Environmental problems are the biggest issue that people have to concern and by product form fossil fuels is one of causes. Someone think one way that can reduce result from fuels is sale car fuels in higher price. In my opinion, I disagree with this because highly price of oil leads to other problems such as financial problem and impact to food price, moreover, we can heal their environment by other ways. The negative effects of increasing the cost of vehciles fuels are improtant to human life. The significant points is price of basic requirements, for instance, foods and medicines which have to transportation by trucks that use oil fuels for movement. The expensive fuels increase business costs, so their products price are rising up. Futhermore, social problems follow by financial problems. When poor people do not have money but they still hunger, they will steal some food or water this situation roads to social problems. Other ways to reduce environment problems, the causes of this problem are not only fossil fuel but also agricultural or industial aspect which we have to focus on. Intustial areas are the top areas that make lot of pollutions such as air pollution, water pollution from thier procesing and chemical pollution which they use during process. Those of them lead to many problems and effect to qulity of human life. Moveover agricultural areas, there produce many of gas which result to global warming. In conclusion, the increasing car fuels might reduce some of environmental problems but also have drawback to population life. We should to chooce other ways to protect enviromant without effect to our life."}
{"text": "When new towns are planned, it is important to build more public parks or sports facilities than shopping centers for people to spend their free time. To what extent do you agree or disagree?Sample EssaySome people argue that town planners should have a preference for more parks and gyms to be created than business districts and shopping malls. While I understand the concerns of people who hold this opinion, it seems to me that shopping centers are just as important as parks and gyms in a town.There are reasons why public facilities are crucial to city inhabitants. First of all, they provide suitable spaces and equipment for people to exercise. For example, people can go jogging in the park and play tennis or basketball at the sports stadium. That helps to keep their bodies fit and it also elevates their mood during the day. Besides, parks and sports facilities are good spots for people to socialize with their neighbors. People can connect with others when they are playing sports or talking casually with passers by in the park. A harmonious relationship between residents helps build a caring and friendly neighborhood.Although parks and gyms give the town dwellers all kinds of benefits, I would like to point out the importance of shopping malls to the district. Firstly, a shopping center could make shopping more convenient for the local residents. It would enable them to easily purchase things in town and transport them home with less effort and at lower cost. They would not need to spend extra money on transportation or shipping of the goods. Secondly, a shopping mall can provide employment. Locals can find work in retail, maintenance or security of the mall, hence earning an income to support their families.In conclusion, although parks and sports facilities serve as places for exercise and social activities for city dwellers, I believe that shopping centers are equally important, since they can provide job opportunities and convenience to the town residents.This essay would score well on Task Achievement because it addresses all parts of the question, discusses reasons for and against building more parks than shopping malls and expresses the opinion of the writer. The main ideas are organized well and explained coherently. The range of vocabulary is adequate for the requirements of the task response. Overall, this essay could get Band 8 in IELTS."}
{"text": "In recent years, in some countries, including Japan, some people believe that governments should cover all tuition fees for students who are willing to study at university. Although the total cost will be massive and the governments need to increase the tax on citizens, I strongly agree with this opinion. To begin with, it is absolutely unfair for students who need to give up going to university because of a lack of money. In Japan, they need to terminate to pursue their study at university, there are many students who study diligently though. If the government supported them financially, those who terminated their study could have continued studying and had the great job opportunities they hoped for. In addition, some developed countries have been suffering from depopulation so there are some industries, such as IT, and Civil engineering that chronically have a problem with how to improve the shortage of employees. If governments encourage students to study these industries at university for free, the companies will be not only helpful to increase the number of employees, and also effective for students to obtain some qualifications in advance in university. This means that the companies do not necessarily spare longer training time than usual for new employees. Furthermore, economic growth is linked inextricably with education. If all students could have a variety of courses at university for free charge, they will be able to obtain skillful techniques and plenty of knowledge to pursue their career opportunities regardless of age. In addition, they will be able to study with working at the same time with light-hearted such as nighttime courses, and weekend courses. If they could work and study flexibly, they will obtain more creative ideas to improve their work. If they are required to pay more tax due to the education fee by governments, they are more than happy to pay the tax for themselves and other ambitious students. In conclusion, the free education system in universities must be advantageous to improve their countries' economic growth in the long term."}
{"text": "This essay was written on a topic from “Target Band 7” book (page 54, reprinted with permission).You should spend about 40 minutes on this taskEducation in financial management should be a mandatory component of the school program. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement?Give reasons for your answer and include examples from your experience.Write at least 250 wordsMore and more young adults in our country are heavily indebted. Thus, it is considered by some that it should be mandatory to educate school children the administration of money. In my opinion, people should not leave school without a sound knowledge of financial management.To begin with, a country’s development is strongly upon the purchasing capacity of its inhabitants. That is to say, people who are in debt or financially vulnerable, would not be able to spend freely or invest, for example, in a new house, thus hindering the economic growth of the country. As a consequence, the rate of inflation would rise and people would be able to afford even less, which could ultimately result in the collapse of the entire economy. A good example of this vicious circle can be seen in countries such as Argentina, where people have to buy household items in the black market, because they cannot afford to buy them in regular stores due to skyrocketing prices. Therefore, it is of utmost importance to teach children early money management.Another point to consider is the low standard of living that people have when they mismanage their finances. Individuals who are constantly short of money could eventually end up being socially isolated and unhappy, because they couldn’t afford to participate in leisure activities, such as going to the cinema with a friend, resulting in their from social life. However, this could be avoided with ease by offering courses in money management.In conclusion, I strongly believe that school children should be taught how to manage their finances to prevent social isolation later in their life as well as to maintain the economic force of their country."}
{"text": "Something that has been debated about a lot recently, people around the world have different views about to whom the design of newly constructed buildings should be controlled by. Today, I am here to discuss both sides of the matter and at the end will give my own view. The people who believe the design of these buildings should be controlled by governments believe so, because they feel that the governments will design the buildings in a way that is not too flashy and nor to minimalistic. It has been seen may times that buildings built by constructing companies/ the financers turn out to be either very flashy or minimalistic. A great example of this is in India's capital, Delhi, where an originally planned office, had exteriors constructed in a very childish and jazzy manner. A thing to also keep in mind that this was the construction of a private office for the top lawyer in Delhi, Arun Deshmukh. He handed over the design of his office to the constructors feeling they won't do anything immature. 4 years later, however, when he went to see the final result of his much-awaited private office, he was completey bewildered by the sight. Instead of seeing a normal office-like building with normal cement on it's exterior, he saw that his dream office looked the exterior of a night club! Instead of normal cement, the exterior was built with transparent glass, and Mr. Deshmukh's name and designation, written in a florescent like way, was carved out on a 3 metre long glass slab!! Coming to the people who believe the control of the design should go to the constructors/people who finance the building think so because they feel that not everything should be in the hands of the government. They also feel that since it was their initiative to get that building built, they should have the final say on how it should look like. When it comes to my opinion, i believe that the control of the design of the building should go to the person/people who first thought of getting it constructed, meaning the people hired architects and did the needful to get an ideal design of the building they want to construct."}

Now it is posible for scientists and turinsts to go in places remote as the South Pole. This possibility have a double face. Some people believe that it positive to have the opportunity to know and visit places we could just imagined until few years ago. On the other hand, others believe we are the resposible for the distruction of certain natural environment. I believe the disadvantages could exceed the advantages. Nowadays, thanks to the techonolical development, we have the great possibility to go anywhere and visit extraordinary places like the South Pole. We can see how the animals live, how it is possible to survive under certain climatic conditions. Furthermore, we can develop more accurate analysis and researches. From the scientific point of you the possibility to go in remote places is surely a crucial chance of discover and lerning something about our planet. Certain places in the last years are also becoming open to the turism. This involve that have been organised ways of transortation as well as hotel have been opened. While, one should see these as advantages concerning the economical status of these isolated places, I belive it is the starting point of the destractuction of the natural environment. Although the workers of turistm sector claim to pay attention in preserving the natural status of places like the South Pole, it is impossibile to believe in them. Indeed, to welcome people and technological instruments is already a way in which a natural enviroment is stressed and ruined. In particular, techonological advices produce radiations, which toghether with chimical and electrical stimuli could afftect the ground of a place like the South Pole. For instance, radiations and electrical stimulations can make the temperature higher and this could be a cause of the environment's ruination. Furthermore, animals who live in the South Pole can be negatively influenced by the turists. Indeed, they are not social animals who have grown up together with human beings. They could get sick because of the noisy sounds produced by humans and by their techonolical advices. In conclusion, I believe that although we can aquire knowledge thanks to the possibility of visiting places like South Pole, our presence is distrupting the environment and could be one of the casuse of some animal species' extinction."}
{"text": "Many people strive to achieve a work-life balance, but often find themselves failing despite their best efforts. This is not surprising, as balancing work and life commitments can be extremely difficult due to both having their unique stressors.One of the major reasons why so many people struggle to achieve harmony between their personal and professional lives is that now it is easier than ever for people to stay connected outside of regular work hours. This has led to an expectation that employees should always be available, and they risk being seen as unreliable or uncommitted if they are not. A knock-on effect of longer working hours is that little time is left for leisure activities such as socialising or engaging in hobbies or sports, which help reduce stress levels and improve overall well-being. This type of pressure and lack of free time can lead to feelings of burnout, with no respite from life’s pressures, resulting in chronic fatigue and diminished motivation over time.Helping those struggling to find a suitable work-life balance will require joint efforts of managers and employees. Workers, for instance, need to recognise the importance of taking regular breaks throughout the day and getting enough sleep each night, while employers should consider being more flexible when it comes to allowing staff to work remotely and offering paid vacation days. This will give employees space, both mentally and physically, enabling them to better manage their commitments without overextending themselves.In conclusion, achieving a successful work-life balance is something that many cannot quite reach due to external pressures from employers and a lack of downtime. However, these issues can be overcome, if we create realistic boundaries between our professional lives and personal goals, and make conscious decisions about how we want to spend our time."}
{"text": "The world today is often divided into two categories, more developed and less developed countries. This division is significant in terms of health, wealth and education. To minimise this gap, it is argued that richer countries are morally responsible to support the less wealthy. I, personally, feel that the prosperous countries are obligated and expected to to contribute to the development of countries with weaker economies.To address this argument, the history of the wealthy countries is relevant. Many less developed countries are former colonies, therefore the wealthy countries had a historical impact on the less wealthy. Thus, richer countries’ economies were dependent on the currently less developed countries for their rich status. Furthermore, even today the wealthy countries contribute to the wealth inequality by exploiting the inhabitants of less developed countries, giving workers lower wages than people within their own countries. Due to this dependence on poorer countries and the influence that the richer countries have had on the imbalance, it can be concluded that richer countries are indeed morally obliged to help the less wealthy countries.Opposing this is the view that each country is in charge of their own inhabitants and that therefore they need to provide health, education and basic necessities for themselves. In addition, simply providing these three services would not lead to closing the wealth gap. It would rather be helpful to invest sustainably in poorer countries and help them create their own systems, allowing these countries to be self-sufficient.In conclusion, while there is a moral necessity for wealthy countries to aid the poorer ones, simply providing basic necessities is not sufficient. A more sustainable idea would be to teach countries to plan and provide for themselves by giving economic incentives."}
{"text": "Despite the fact that millions of people in the world go hungry every day, a surprisingly large amount of food gets wasted daily in certain parts of the world. In my opinion, the main reason for this is that people in the first-world countries tend to only buy food that is aesthetically pleasing, and fortunately, there are some ways to tackle this issue.It is shockingly sad to know that large amounts of perfectly edible food in the form of fresh produce get sent to landfills, and the main reason for this is that these foods do not meet the standards of perfection set for fruits and vegetables by consumers and grocery stores. For example, veggies and fruit that are misshapen or have a few spots on them are still good enough to eat, yet they are often left on shelves to rot in favour of something that looks less damaged. In addition, a lot of customers confuse the ‘best by’ and ‘use by’ dates, thinking that foods that have passed their ‘best by’ dates are no longer fit to eat. Another major reason for food wastage is that people often overestimate the amount of produce they require on a weekly or monthly basis, and most of it ends up getting thrown out instead of being used.There are many ways to reduce the amount of food being wasted, and I think one of the best ideas is to increase people’s awareness of just how much good food is disposed of, only because of our superficial biases as to how food should look. Raising the awareness of the staggering number of people that go hungry in third-world countries would make it harder to throw away an apple just because it is a little bruised. Also, teaching people how to better plan their monthly food requirements would help them not to overspend on food that they do not need; it would be great for the environment and their budget. The role of the government in this endeavour is indispensable as such task would be too great for any smaller organisation.To conclude, the wasting food is a serious issue that merits increased awareness from both people and the leaders of the world. It is unacceptable to discard any food when there are so many people who are starving, and hopefully our joint effort can help improve the current situation."}
{"text": "The responsibility for providing funds for retirement is incredibly important and something that is often overlooked by younger people. Some believe it is the responsibility of the individual to plan for this, but others feel it is the responsibility of the state.People who believe that the state should be responsible for funding retirees, base their argument on the fact that in most countries, people pay taxes and social charges to the government. This money, they argue, should also go towards the provision of a pension for the person paying the tax. In addition, those who have very small or no income, pay little or no tax and do not have the ability to provide for themselves. The government, therefore, in its role of caring for the population, has an obligation to pay a pension and provide other social benefits, such as medical treatment.Many others, however, feel that it is the responsibility of individuals to fund their own retirements. As adults, they argue, people should be able to set aside and invest money throughout their lifetime, so that they can retire with few financial worries. In many countries the government has legislated a framework allowing and encouraging citizens to save up and accumulate sufficient funds for the period after their working years have ended.I neither agree nor disagree with the statement, but rather my opinion takes in parts of both arguments. I feel that people should be responsible for saving money to fund their retirement, but I also feel that individuals who have not had the chance to do so should be supported by the government out of taxes. In my view, therefore, it is wrong to say that governments have no obligation to help people in this area. Governments are there to support the entire population of their countries, which includes the poorer elements of society."}
{"text": "Many metropolises are facing challenges, including traffic gams and serious lacking of housing available for families to live, particular in the developed countries. The governments are looking for a way to lessen the volume of traffic in the cities and to increase the number of housing provision over the metropolises. Some people advocate the businesses including large corporations and factories along with their employees moving to the suburbs which is the best way to figure out the metropolitan problems. Is this a sheer solution for these challenges faced by the cities? Economy boom in a country is accompanied with a number of problems incurred in the cities due to the multitudes living in there. It is no wonder that metropolises represent more job opportunities available and better education system to next generations. These are strong pull factors appealing people to stay in the cities despite the higher cost in living. A larger number of populations in the cities not only result in a severe shortage of housing where there is a higher demand of housing over the available supply, but also bring the higher volume of traffic across the cities, particular in a peak hour when a thousand and one employees commuting to work and students going to schools. Some people believe the working location shifting to rural areas is a solution that enables to lessen the frequent usage of roads in cities. Simultaneously, it is assumed that the housing issue can be solved naturally arising from the migration of their employees into the suburban town next to their working place. The business allocated to suburbs alone is rarely considered enough to tackle these problems. A place to live requires the basic facilities to serve for clothing, food, housing and transportation which are basic needs of human. If there is a working place and residential area only in the suburban town without any infrastructures, people have no choice to drive their vehicles back and forth between cities and their living places for the general consumption. As a consequence, the traffic congestion in cities will be worsen combining with the significant deterioration of air quality in the countryside due to an increase in the emission of the greenhouse gases. Therefore, the governments play a key role to establish a neighborhood which could be self-sufficient communities outside of their larger metropolitan areas. This may be a feasible and effective way to minimize the metropolitan issues. My own view is that the shifting strategies in suburbs can help lessen the challenges faced by metropolises. But the governments should take the smart planning into consideration in which the employment bases with the living infrastructures are developed in the suburban town."}
{"text": "As society becomes more and more saturated with technology, traditional cultures are losing their roles in society. The compatibility of technology and traditions are often debated where some suggest it is possible, whereas, others argue it is not. In this essay, I will discuss both perspectives and conclude by saying how and why it is almost impossible. Since people usually appreciate limited ways of living, it is challenging for both conventions and technology to co-exist. They will usually choose one method or another but not both at the same time. For instance, a company would have to focus on using human labour or advanced machineries to produce a product. The incompatibility may not be obvious at first but as technology develops futher, use of machines will increase but employment will decrease. Furthermore, technology is often considered to be more convenient and faster by many people. Work can be done more efficiently so workers will start to abandon the old ways of living or working. In contrast, it might be possible for two values to work along in society due to different tastes of various people. Traditional cultures are usually appreciated by old generation such as grandparents, meanwhile, new generation prefers technology in their life. For example, grandparents can read newspaper while grandchildren watch TV or play games during family time. Moreover, although it is hard for a company to use both at the same time, it is not totally impossible. If the number of machines is controlled during production, human labour and machines can work together to maximise productivity by covering up each other's disadvantages. All in all, even though traditional values and technology can be compatible theoratically, it is indeed difficult to compromise the use between two in real life. Ergo, people would have to beware of the risk of losing traditional cultures, if at all."}
{"text": "Whether people should be encouraged more to study vocational courses due to the lack of workforce in that area or be encouraged to study at the university remains a big discussion. I believe both of these areas of study should be promoted equally, countries need academics as well as qualified workers. One of the reasons that supports the encouragement to study either area, academic or vocational, is the worldwide need for the two types of professionals. For example, Australian government is currently offering work visas and permanent residencies to overseas qualified workers such as, carpenters, cooks, bar managers as well as doctors, nurses and psychologists. Essentially, this demonstrates that the two areas are equally needed and this happens in Canada and England too. Another point to be considered is the increase in the people's needs due to the population growth, which, therefore, affects the need for more experts in all sectors. This includes professional from different fields, such as science, construction and even thinkers. If people is encouraged to study more in one field than others, this might be detrimental to societies, leaving one sector significantly more affected. Eventually, countries need a balance in the areas choosen for people to growth a career. In conclusion, I support the idea of encouraging both, university and vocational studies. Many countries worldwide have expressed their need for the two types of workers. Besides, as the population is rapidly increasing, the need for experts in multiples areas is increasing too, so promoting both is the only way to maintain a balance."}
{"text": "In today's world, extreme sports are getting popular among people like sky diving and skiing. It is an adrenaline rush sport where people step beyond their limits. In my opinion, such sport should not be banned just because they are dangerous. Firstly, such extreme sports should not be banned as they are also sport just like any other sport. furthermore, major sports like cricket are also not the safest to play as the ball is made of solid leather it can put crack on someone's head which is extremely dangerous. extreme sports are meant for enjoyment and they also help to release some stress. Secondly, if such sports are conducted properly then it should not be as dangerous like there should be guidelines where they make sure that pieces of equipment are in excellent condition and where they do make sure a safety check. Lastly, despite being extreme, many find themselves indulging in such activity because it helps them reduce their stress at work or home. The reason is that when we engage in sports, our body releases oxytocin, a hormone that alleviates stress and helps us feel more relaxed and peaceful unlike when we are bombarded with phone calls or emails from clients. In conclusion, I disagree with the eradication of extreme sports as it provides thrills and also boosts someone's confidence as they move beyond their limitation. people all around the world love to indulge in such activities where they feel an adrenaline rush in their whole body."}
{"text": "With ever increasing technological advances, computers and robots are replacing human roles in different areas of society. This trend can also be seen in education, where interactive programs can enhance the educational experience for children and young adults. Whether, however, this revolution can also take over the role of the teacher completely is debatable, and I oppose this idea as it is unlikely to serve students well.The roles of computers and robots can be seen in many areas of the workplace. Classic examples are car factories, where a lot of the repetitive precision jobs done on assembly lines have been performed by robots for many years, and medicine, where diagnosis, and treatment, including operations, have also been assisted by computers for a long time. According to the media, it won’t also be long until we have cars that are driven automatically.It has long been discussed whether robots and computers can do this in education. It is well known that the complexity of programs can now adapt to so many situations that something can already be set up that has the required knowledge of the teacher, along with the ability to predict and answer all questions that might be asked by students. In fact, due to the nature of computers, the knowledge levels can far exceed a teacher’s and have more breadth, as a computer can have equal knowledge in all the subjects that are taught in school, as opposed to a single teacher’s specialisation. It seems very likely, therefore, that computers and robots should be able to deliver the lessons that teachers can, including various ways of differentiating and presenting materials to suit varying abilities and ages of students.Where I am not convinced is in the pastoral role of teachers. Part of teaching is managing behaviour and showing empathy with students, so that they feel cared for and important. Even if a robot or computer can be programmed to imitate these actions, students will likely respond in a different way when they know an interaction is part of an algorithm rather than based on human emotion.Therefore, although I feel that computers should be able to perform a lot of the roles of teachers in the future, they should be used as educational tools to assist teachers and not to replace them. In this way, students would receive the benefits of both ways of instruction."}
{"text": "I partially agree to the opinion that hosting an international sports event has positive effects for the country. In most cases It is good for the country as it gives a chance to show off the nation's culture and power, but sometimes the cost of holding the event outnumber the benefits from it. I will break down my opinion here with the examples of Seoul Olympic in 1988 and Tokyo Olympic in 2021. Seoul Olympic was held in 1988 in Seoul, the capital of South Korea. It gave the nation great chance to advertise its prosperity. Many audiences got deep impression on how the country erected from the ashes of Korean war. In addition, the event had an important meaning in diplomacy, as it was an Olympic game that all communist and capitalist countries gathered after a long time. The event was prepared firmly, as South Korean knew how much this game was important to them. South Korea can earn lots of reputation, as well as money from many foreign travellers On the other hand, Tokyo Olympic was held in 2021, in the middle of pandemic because of Covid-19. It was originally planned to be held in 2020, but postponed because of the danger of mass infection. This delay costed a lot of money to the hosting country. In addition, there were many problems in preparing the event, because of the spread of the disease. Moreover, only small amount of travellers can visit Tokyo to see the game, because of the tight regulations on travel to prevent international transmission of the disease. As a result, the money earned during the game was much less than the cost to prepare it, and its advertising effect was minor. As we can see in these two cases, hosting an international sports event can be good in some cases, but it can be wasteful in other cases. The success in hosting international games depends on many elements. Time of the game is important, and global atmosphere is important as well. Most of all, how well the country is prepared is a key factor that the event can be successful."}

{"text": "As we all know, recruitment is a continuous process that has been evolving over the past years. Nowadays, selection of qualified applicants is a tedious job which involves a considerable amount of time and effort. It has been stated that wealthy countries must allow experienced and intelligent employees from impoverished countries to secure a job in an affluent nation. I completely agree with this statement. In this essay, reasons and examples will be discussed further. Recruitment mainly involves identification of potential applicants, screening, interviewing and hiring candidates for a particular organization. It may seem a daunting task for those working in human resources. With the advent of technology, the process is simplified, faster and more convenient. Mostly, email is used for applying and sending the credentials abroad, chances of getting hired is often possible. For instance, many immigrants from Asia, which belongs to developing countries are able to successfully obtain an employment in North America with the help of social media platforms. Also, with their valuable experience and rewarding career in the past, they were able to practice their profession in newly industralized countries. It is beneficial for them to accept skilled workers from economically poor countries to fill in the vacancies in labor market. For instance, a highly respected nurse who earned her bachelor's degree back home decided to work overseas as a healthcare aide eventhough she's overqualified for the position while waiting for her credential evaluation and license. This scenario depicts that rich countries benefit and utilize this person's ability to contribute significantly in the economy. In addition, job recruitment is advantageous for the country since talents and skills of the people from developing countries has been internationally recognized, thereby giving a sense of pride and honor. Moreover, hiring of people overseas should be a fair procedure that takes into consideration the most indispensable requirement which is skills and knowledge, not merely based on the worker's country of origin. However, there are also drawbacks associated from recruitment of foreign workers which include increasing costs, loss of cultural ties and conflict of interest. From my perspective, I am in favor of hiring people from third world countries since majority of these people has the expertise, achievements and excellent communication skills which are desirable attributes of an employee. With enough manpower, it will address the staffing crisis and labor shortage in rich countries."}
{"text": "The increasing prevalence of furious sports has been a great concern. Owning to this, some assume that the Governments should abolish this type of sports while others contend that citizens should have a right to immerse in any activities, regardless of its high-risk characteristics. In my opinion, the policies ought to focus on participants's assurance instead of banning any sports. On the one hand, the propose of prohibiting extreme sports should not be approved because it is against the democratic society. Inevitably, the participating in risky sports is one of residents' rights. As a result, the intervention of the Admistrations in this case will prevent them from their own interests illegally. Moreover, the extreme sports abolishment may extinguish carreers and dreams of numerous professional athletes and trainees. Therefore, banning is not a reasonable approach in this situation. On the other hand, authorizing freedom in playing dangerous sports generates several matters. Understandably, participants mostly risk their health and lives being involved in these activities, from violence and physical injuries, which means the furious characteristics are posing a threat to their own existences. In addition, the prohibition on those sports can orientate hobby development for future generation on healthy sports, requiring less violence and intension. This, therefore, leads to a more tranquil community. Finally, according to my perspective, the Administrations should attempt to handle safety assurance and enhance risk education in those players. Under this circumstance, the residents are equipped with protective support and still allowed to enjoy and follow their passion. This then would be the optimal way to meet residents' demand. Conclusively, I personally believe the solution is not about whether the Governments should forbid furious sports activities, but about providing them protective assurance and risk acknowledgement."}

When such person comes out of prison, it is very often the case that they have the same few opportunities for a legitimate income. In fact, these opportunities will even be reduced, as employers are often less willing to give an ex-prisoner a job. Some people also return to crime, as they spend all the time of their prison sentence with other criminals. This is not a great environment for rehabilitation, and sometimes even a network of contacts can be made to help develop criminal activities on release.One important way to help address this problem is education. Criminals who have turned to illegal activities because of no alternatives to earn a living need to learn a way to earn a wage, such as a trade or vocational skills. Computer skills, for example, are in high demand and someone trained in these could very possibly find work. In addition, governments can offer incentives to employers to attract them to give jobs to newly-released prisoners. This would help people who don’t really want to return to crime achieve a fresh start. As keeping people in prison is an expensive business, governments might find it cheaper to pay these incentives.To sum up, people returning to crime is a tragedy that should be avoided if at all possible in today’s society. Education and incentives can directly address the reasons for it and could make society a happier and safer place."}
{"text": "Some people think that spending a lot on holding wedding parties, birthday parties and other celebrations is just a waste of money. Others, however, think that these are necessary for individuals and the society. Discuss both views and give your opinion.Throwing parties can be expensive. While some people do not find these fancy gatherings worth what they cost, others believe such events are important to both individuals and the society.People choose to throw parties for a number of reasons. For starters, they can make better teams. Project kick-off parties are good opportunities to break the ice and help team members to know each other better. Celebrating a victory create a sense of success and belonging. Companies do not see parties as of money and allocate budget to support such events; moreover, they often leave good memories. From our own experiences, we all have happy memories of our birthday parties when we were little. Every family has great photos at family gatherings in their album. In addition, contrary to what some people believe that spending on parties is a waste of social resources, they actually create value, either by employing people in the party-planning business or by offering people better experiences.The popularity of parties, however, causes some tension in the society. They are hard on introverted people who find themselves uncomfortable in the crowd. This is a clinic symptom which psychologists call “social anxiety disorder”. There are other ways to celebrate important events that may have greater value for their cost. For instance, companies could send out gifts after successful projects and parents could take their children on family trips to celebrate birthdays.In my opinion, while a party is a form of social event that brings many benefits to individuals and the society, other choices should also be considered, either to cut spending or to relieve the stress of those who are not fond of crowded celebrations."}

{"text": "Social media today is extremely significant to a majority of the population, especially the younger generation. Many teenagers find it exceptionally convenient and necessary for communication and entertainment. However, not everyone is able to use social media responsibly, which gave rise to the idea of making it accessible to only those older than eighteen years of age.Though there are negatives, such as cyber-bullying, or being too distracted by these modern media, there are issues surrounding most things in life. It is a choice to go onto a social media website, and many younger people are capable of managing accounts without any difficulties. It is not the government’s responsibility to monitor under eighteen-year olds; that is for the parents.Statistics show that over eighty per cent of teens use a form of online social media. It allows them to chat online, easily stay in contact with friends and family across the world, and see updates on others’ lives (through text, photos or videos). Social media is a way to express thoughts or ideas and to stay in contact with the rest of the world.To not permit one of the largest Internet-using demographics to use social media because a few people have problems with it is an irrational and an unfair restriction. Not only would profit be lost with fewer users, but controlling who creates accounts and monitoring proof of age would be difficult as well. I believe that laws should not make social media inaccessible to young people under eighteen; this would be unnecessary and absurd."}
{"text": "Travelling today is simple to the extent that within twelve hours one can travel from Europe to Singapore, crossing nearly the whole globe. Based on this simplicity, tourism has changed significantly over the years. While in the past a family would be proud to drive two hours to a lake, many families now think nothing of travelling to the far side of the world. This also has a downside as increased pollution is a result. Extra taxes on flights or accommodation have therefore been offered as a solution so as to increase the cost of tourism and reduce its popularity.No matter what major transportation is used, travelling creates pollution. To decrease the amount of pollution caused by tourism, the tourism industry itself would have to be weakened. If these increased taxes are based on travelling distance, people would be more willing to stay closer to their home country, as for many even a slight increase would mean that their planned holidays would be too expensive. Accommodation taxes would raise holiday costs no matter the distance travelled. Therefore, if increased taxes were levied on travel and accommodation, tourism and therefore pollution would decrease.On the other hand, the main transport methods that would be impacted by imposing extra taxes would be communal ones, such as planes, trains and buses, and increasing the taxes would also impact non-tourists. Also, holidays are a vital part of ordinary people’s lives, as they escape from work and stress, and get to spend valuable time with their families. Stopping people travelling would greatly impact some simple pleasures of ordinary life.In conclusion, while tourism impacts the environment significantly, simply introducing extra taxes on transport or accommodation is a drastic measure. It could be more valuable to change the methods of transportation to decrease pollution, instead making people stay close to home."}

{"text": "Despite to the presence of vast amount of translation programs on computers and other electronic devices, it is still considered more beneficial in terms of learning language itself. In this essay, I will be describing my total agreement with this dilemma. The utmost reason for learning new language instead of using various programs is that human brain makes necessary changes in its structure and produces necessary chemical substances which in turn gives other functions to the brain. As a result of this human brain gains new functions in addition to the language skills. Another benefit coming from directly learning language is the opportunity to express your beliefs and emotions in that language which is impossible to realize via software programs. People around the speaker tend to understand the spoken language more easily and get the speaker's ultimate goal in a more usual and humane way. The third reason for studying the language rather than carrying a software to translate might be the possibility of immediately using language. In other words, software programs can not find the right words according to the situations or conversations among people. As a consequence of this, due to different meanings which translation devices remain useless in such cases, huge misunderstandings can occur. In a conclusion, in addition to the reasons mentioned above, using language by learning it always seems realiable and more realistic way than using device for this purpose. As I raised my pure opinion toward gaining language skill earlier I strongly believe that this method has been the most preferable method for decades and it will be."}
{"text": "Banning cars from the centre of various cities around the world has been a strategy to reduce pollution and encourage people to use public transport. It has had various positive effects for both individuals and for society as a whole.Banning cars from the centre of cities seems to be a very positive development. Fewer cars on the road means less pollution and fewer fossil fuel resources being used up. Although the effect on resources might be relatively negligible, it can create a newer way of thinking regarding the dynamics of transport within cities and this could be the most important benefit to society. Some people working in the centre of these cities may complain about inconvenience, but many would agree that this is a small price to pay.A reduction in the reliance of people on private vehicles is likely to encourage them to use public transport or even bicycles. Using public transport, especially the types that run on clean sources of power, will significantly raise air quality levels in cities, which will of course benefit everyone. The clean air could even further encourage the use of bicycles, which would in turn promote more healthy lifestyles and less obesity. This would contribute on an individual level to people’s well-being and a better and longer life, and on a societal level, it would lessen the strain on public health resources. Governments could encourage this by creating more bicycle lanes to make cycling easier and safer.In conclusion, it is clear that banning cars from the centre of cities is significantly beneficial. Better health and ecology, as well as improvement in longevity and well-being can benefit individuals and the entire society."}
{"text": "The topic of motivation for work has merely failed to be discussed. Someone elaborate that the most significant factor is money while others suppose it is not. As far as I am concerned, although money is of great importance, it cannot always be the most valuable one. Undoubtedly, money can be a crucial factor to diminish the financial burden of families, especially for those who were born in a poverty-stricken area. To be more specific, only by earning sufficient money can they raise their later generations and keep the elderly. Provided that they cannot find a decent job that allow them to own some disposable money, it would add insult to injury. However, there are a great number of factors that may be considered as worthwhile to be the motivation of stay in the staff by some people. First of all, being in the workforce can help to strengthen an individual’s interpersonal skills. It is widely acknowledged that there are a colossal number of activities as well as team programmes that require people to collaborate, compromise and compete with the others. Thus, individuals will tend to learn some social skills and become gregarious and sociable, which can help them better adapt themselves to the mainstream society. In addition, people may also get a chance to broaden their horizons and lay a firm basis for future development by staying in the workforce. For instance, under the circumstance that numerous companies may provide the staff with the opportunity to go abroad and get involved in some international programs, people are able to get access to different cultures. As a result, people can develop panning-for-gold thinking rather than sponge-feeding thinking in the process of understanding divergent cultures, which can be beneficial for their future careers. In conclusion, although money is valuable for individuals to be in the workforce, there are many other factors that cannot be overlooked. Only by treating all the factors rationally can we enjoy the pleasure rather than pressure."}
{"text": "People tend to use more informal words in their language to express and communicate with each other rather than following formal words. There are several reasons for this, and I believe that it has some disadvantages and advantages. The key contributor to informal writing is technological innovation. For instance, WhatsApp, Facebook Messenger, and Instagram allow people to send texts to each other anywhere and anytime just by connecting to the internet. Furthermore, the texting culture of using abbreviated phrases has grown increasingly prevalent. As a result, applying casual language in written form has become more popular, and this substantially affects the written language. I believe that this trend may carry a certain degree of risk. Firstly, when using written language in an easier going way many times, people can forget how to write a formal letter. In fact, the current generation gets used to texting, so the young are not aware of how to write a formal email to apply for a job. Instead, they write these emails like they are texting with friends. Secondly, informal writing can adversely affect the academic performance of students. The students tend to utilize abbreviated words or slang in essays and assignments that require a greater level of formality. One evident benefit to having more informal written communication in our professional lives is that it is less time-consuming. For instance, busy individuals working on the same task can share information instantly through a quick chat, rather than write a long and formal mail chain that requires thoughtful editing and proofreading. In conclusion, although there are disadvantages to using informal words in written language, there are also attractive advantages. I believe individuals should use informal words when texting with family and friends but when it's an office or business-related work then they should use formal words in written language."}
{"text": "Traditionally in many parts of the world, it has been women who have stayed at home to care for children. This has led to the ideology and expectation that women are more suited to this type of work than men.The overwhelming status quo where women stay at home to care for the children probably derives from the fact that women are the ones who have to actually give birth to children and, following that, they are the ones who for the early part of a child’s life have to feed the child until it is weaned. In times past, this state of affairs probably led to the women assuming the permanent role of carer for the home and children, whilst men went out to work, whether it was to gather food or work in fields or factories.In spite of the fact that this became what was expected in family dynamics, it does not mean that men are necessarily less suited to caring for a child than women. It is very possible for men to care for a child, even from birth onwards in today’s world. Babies’ milk formula can be mixed by anyone and fed to a child. The fact that many women today choose not to do this again does not mean that they are better suited by nature to care for the child.Suitability for childcare is a matter for individual temperament and aptitude. Not many people, whether they are men or women, feel totally confident and knowledgeable about how to care for a baby or young child at the start. They need advice from their own mothers and fathers, midwives or from books. It is only from experience that skill with childcare comes and this skill can be acquired regardless of gender.All in all, I do not agree with the statement that men are less suited to childcare than women. I believe that aptitude to look after children is a matter of individual temperament, not gender-specific inherited qualities."}
{"text": "High-rise apartment blocks are a common sight in cities around the world. They are especially popular in large cities and in locations where building land is scarce. Living in such buildings has various advantages and disadvantages for town planners and the inhabitants themselves.The most significant advantage of high-rise apartment blocks is probably for the town planners. With land often being at a premium in large cities, one way to maximise space is to build upwards, so that the population density per square kilometre can be increased. The demand for housing in big cities can therefore be more easily met. There are also disadvantages for town planners. The heavier population density can put added pressure on social facilities, for example sewage and other waste disposal, and the provision of adequate school and medical services.There are also advantages and disadvantages for the actual inhabitants of high-rise apartment blocks. With the demand for housing being reduced, prices are therefore not as high, making housing more affordable. Many people also like not having to be responsible for a garden, and living in an apartment has this advantage. Finally, with so many people living in the same area, many friendships can be made and a community spirit can be built up. It appears the most significant disadvantage is that, in practice, living in high-rise apartment blocks is just not the lifestyle many people want. In some city neighbourhoods, these living spaces can often be associated with poor living conditions and undesirable social elements. In addition, many people view high-rise apartment blocks as being unsafe. For example, in the case of fire, tall buildings are difficult or impossible to evacuate safely.It is clear that high-rise apartment blocks have benefits and drawbacks. It is also clear, however, that due to the need to house increasing numbers of people in cities, these architectural features are here to stay, whether people like them or not."}
{"text": "Some people think that public health within a country can be improved by government making laws regarding nutritious food. Others, however, think that health is a matter of personal choice and responsibility. Discuss both views and give your opinion.Personal and public health are tightly related to food choices. While some people believe that the government should regulate nutrition to improve public wellness, others argue that it should be people’s decision whether to pursue a healthy diet or not. This essay will discuss both points of view and explain why the authorities should not control the types of food people can buy.Legislators could impose laws concerning nutritious food in an effort to have a healthier population, public health costs. Even if this could be considered a good idea, it would be very quite difficult to implement. To achieve this target, the rulers could impose a levy on unhealthy food options, or reduce their availability on the grocery stores shelves. In Italy, for example, products such as carbonated sugary drinks and chips are heavily taxed. As a result, the sales of these items have decreased. However, if the authorities start to take control of what their citizens can or cannot eat, it may be seen as limitation of freedom.Since personal freedom is an extremely important human right, many people think that they should be responsible for their choices regarding the food and drinks they decide to consume. I agree with this opinion because limiting nutritional options, even if it is done with the best outcome in mind, could consequently create dissatisfaction among the population, which would possibly lead to other public issues such as protests and demonstrations. A better approach could be educating the public about a healthy diet, which would help people make better-informed decisions about the food they consume. Many developed countries around the world employed this strategy and saw public health gains.In conclusion, even though the government is able to control the dietary habits of its population through taxation and restrictions, healthier citizens and reduced public health expenses isn’t the only possible outcome. Limiting personal freedom could result in social unrest and for that reason diet decisions are better to be left up to well-informed individuals.This response achieved the task requirements by discussing whether the government or individuals should be in control of their diet. The ideas are developed and supported by examples, the information is organised in paragraphs, and coherence is maintained throughout the essay. A range of sentences structures and advanced vocabulary is used in this work."}
{"text": "Many people believe that international tourism is a bad thing for their countries. What are the reasons for this? What can be done to change this negative attitude towards international tourism?Many individuals think that foreign tourism brings negative effects to their countries. There are several reasons for such negative attitude towards international travelers. However, a couple of solutions could be adopted to handle this situation, as will now be discussed.International tourists are often criticized for their contribution to the environmental degradation. It has continuously been noticed that they throw rubbish in their surroundings irresponsibly, which increases the amount of litter everywhere, despite all attempts to reduce waste produced by the local community. This contributes to water, air and soil contamination.Furthermore, foreign tourism has a harmful influence on traditional customs and indigenous practices of host countries because many tourists are careless and insensitive the emotions and feelings of local residents. For instance, in India, some foreign travelers wear inappropriate clothes or expose too much of skin when they visit sacred places, which leads to some negative attitude and the local public.However, this situation can be improved different solutions which could be handled by the government. The government should explain the benefits of international tourism which contributes to the development of local . They not only spend money in shops and restaurants but also create jobs in service industries, and this aspect could be publicized. Additionally, the government should increase the awareness among the foreigners through different media such as roadside billboards and advertisements, and tourists should be encouraged to get rid of rubbish correctly.In conclusion, the inhospitable feeling that the local people have for international tourists can be explained in many ways. However, in my opinion, the government’s involvement is essential to change the negative attitude by citing various advantages of international tourism to their country and raising awareness among tourists in order to protect local habitats.This essay covers the entire task topic by exploring both reasons for negative attitude towards international tourism and some possible actions to change it. The writer explains why locals may resent international tourists and suggests what steps can be taken to transform the way people feel about foreigners in their country."}
{"text": "It is no doubt that cities are amongst the most convienient places for accommodation but with it, comes many sophisticated issuses, threatening the residents quality of life.In my opinion,in order to solve this problem,it is essential for governments balance the country's population distribution by encouring people to move to rural areas. What are the difficulties while living in large cities then?Firstly, it is the lack of jobs and occupations due to the fierce competitiveness between thousands of applicants.Moreover,because of high number of employees,regularly will companies raise their standards making it painfully challenging to get a job .For instance,to be hired as an accountant,not only do you need flawless techinque skills but also flexibility and adaptiveness to satisfy the company's demand and surpass other applicants.Secondly,the increasing population density can be a potential security endangerment as the rate of criminals and lawbreakers is significantly higher than places with fewer residents.Furthermore,tracking down criminals will more challenging because of the widespread radius of populated areas.For example,chasing down a theif in a countryside would be far more easier than a city because there are less space to hide and shelter for the theifs. Hence, the government should encourage people to move to outlying areas.At first glance,it fixes the issue of jobs and occupation as civilians are now fairly distributed to other regions, creating a less stressing and competitive working environment.As a matter of fact,the rate of poverty and famine will be reduced as the income for most famlies become higher thanks to more job opportunities.In addition,by having scatterd citizen equally,we can ensure the safety of our people by managing the crime rate of each region.In fact,this will prevent crime concentration in one area but scatter them in many places,making it more convenient to protect civilians. In conclusion,living in large cities can have multiple drawbacks,especially job opportunity and security therefore motivating citizen relocate to urban areas should be considered as soon as possible for the reasons above."}
{"text": "There are many ways to learn new knowledge and skills. Traditional educational routes, such as school followed by college or university is one route that is generally accepted and respected by today’s society. It can be argued, however, that this is not always the best way. A more vocational route can be more appropriate for certain people and for particular jobs.Universities generally have deference given to them and, due to this, most schools tailor their programs to help students get university admission. Universities usually have respected and highly qualified teachers who have the knowledge and the skills to take their students to very high levels of knowledge and expertise. The very difficulty of gaining admission, getting through the duration of the course and passing final exams ensures to employers that graduates have the necessary self-discipline, intelligence and ability to get through the courses.Universities are also particularly well suited to the teaching of various subjects, for example, medicine, law and literature and these subjects need students’ full-time attention in order to do well. Although vocational experience is necessary, a certain grounding in basic concepts to a high-level is important. Once this knowledge has been acquired, students can then integrate their knowledge with practical understanding.This, however, is not the case for all areas of learning, especially ones where the quantity of high level knowledge is not required or is possible to be learned whilst working at the same time. Young people studying to be an electrician or a plumber are good examples. To do this work well requires a lot of experience, yet also a sound understanding of theory. The learning here can be and is done working and studying at the same time, often through apprenticeships and vocational courses involving significant amounts of work experience.Therefore, in my opinion, there are more ways than one to acquire a profession. Whether learning should take place at university alone or whilst working depends on the course and the end job."}
{"text": "The world today is often divided into two categories, more developed and less developed countries. This division is significant in terms of health, wealth and education. To minimise this gap, it is argued that richer countries are morally responsible to support the less wealthy. I, personally, feel that the prosperous countries are obligated and expected to to contribute to the development of countries with weaker economies.To address this argument, the history of the wealthy countries is relevant. Many less developed countries are former colonies, therefore the wealthy countries had a historical impact on the less wealthy. Thus, richer countries’ economies were dependent on the currently less developed countries for their rich status. Furthermore, even today the wealthy countries contribute to the wealth inequality by exploiting the inhabitants of less developed countries, giving workers lower wages than people within their own countries. Due to this dependence on poorer countries and the influence that the richer countries have had on the imbalance, it can be concluded that richer countries are indeed morally obliged to help the less wealthy countries.Opposing this is the view that each country is in charge of their own inhabitants and that therefore they need to provide health, education and basic necessities for themselves. In addition, simply providing these three services would not lead to closing the wealth gap. It would rather be helpful to invest sustainably in poorer countries and help them create their own systems, allowing these countries to be self-sufficient.In conclusion, while there is a moral necessity for wealthy countries to aid the poorer ones, simply providing basic necessities is not sufficient. A more sustainable idea would be to teach countries to plan and provide for themselves by giving economic incentives."}

What are the advantages and disadvantages of this?One of the most conspicuous trends of today’s world is a colossal surge in the number of vehicle accidents cars, trucks and buses, all over the , be it in impoverished or developed nations. There is a wide range of factors that . In my opinion, this situation could be remedied, provided some effective measures are taken.Measures to deal with this soaring concern are many; the most significant are not remote or complicated but accessible and practicable. The primary one lies in the fact that governments should take a firm stance and apply stringent rules and regulations to lower the speed limit. Secondly, using electronic devices while driving should be forbidden by law. Finally, an awareness program could be initiated by individuals to educate the public about the catastrophic effects of unsafe roads and the projected enhancements for road safety. Only when convergent efforts from all sectors are ensured, can we expect to see considerable progress in tackling this problem.There is a deluge of merits for implementation of reduced speed limits. High speed is likely to impose life threatening danger on people crossing the roads, due to the perilous nature of this hazardous speed with danger being an integral part of it. Not only does reducing the speed limits contribute to decreasing daily accidents, but it also raises the standard of driving. Needless to say, all these advantages have a far-reaching impact on pedestrian safety.There are, however, some pitfalls that can easily overpower the potential benefits of limiting speed. The primary one stems from the fact that slowing the speed could lead to augmenting the daily traffic hours. Besides, it could also delay delivering sick and patients to hospitals. Hence, it is apparent why some individuals are against changing the standardized level of speed.From what has been discussed, one can conclude that despite the drawbacks of reducing speed limits, the expected benefits of this measure are indeed far greater."}
{"text": "The topic of gay marriage merely failed to be discussed. However, when it comes to whether gay marriage should be allowed legally, individuals hold divergent views. As far as I am concerned, the government should treat gay marriage as a legal thing. Undoubtedly, gay marriage can be beneficial. First of all, it is able to shrink the disparity between the affluent and the impoverished. For instance, some countries which allow gay marriage legally have become well-known tourism sites now by attracting foreign gays to come. Thus, their tourism industry can be thrived and the moribund local economy can be turned into the resurgent one, which may help to avoid turning the gap into gulf. Additionally, allowing gay marriage to be legal is also able to undermine the crime rate. On condition that some gays cannot enjoy the right of marriage, they may feel underrated, underprivileged and underappreciated, which may give them the predisposition to revenge the society to express their resentment and dissatisfaction. What is more, the government is able to diminish cultural conflict through making gay marriage a law. Provided that some individuals get little acquainted with gay culture, they may deem it as aggressive. However, by admitting it as a low, we can minimize such vulnerability and promote the mutual understanding of divergent cultures. On the other hand, treating gay marriage legally also has various disadvantages. Firstly, it may undermine family rapport for the reason that some family members may not willing to accept gay marriage, which may cause the increasingly indifferent among family members and finally lead to family skirmish and splintering. In addition, some young individuals are possible to make mistakes at an early age if the government makes gay marriage law. It is widely acknowledged that some young people are not mature enough to choose the right partner. Provided that they get married at an early age, they may suffer irreversible loss. To sum up, although there are some disadvantages to let gay marriage be legal, the benefits of it are multifaceted. Considering the development of the economy and culture, I agree with allowing gay marriage to be a legal option."}

Some people believe that sports which are played in teams are more beneficial like football, while others think that solo sports like tennis or swimming is better. The following essay will discuss both arguments and give my opinion that sports which are played in teams have more advantages over solo sport activites. First of all, there is no doubt that the individual sport activities enahnce people confidence. It helps building the personality and strentghen the mentality of the individuals. For examole, one role model in my home country was playing tennis table, he mentioned once in an interview, that sport helped him not only to win trophies but it raised his mental strength and shaped his pesonality. However, some people believe that, sports which are played in teams have more advantages and all community will get the benefits. Soccer, for example, will help the players specifically the young children to understand working together and sharing the responsibility. In addition people will grow with better understanding to the concept of sharing achievements which can improve all the community. For instance, i was a member of soccer team in high school, me and my friends were taught, in order to win games we should put plans together and work as one unit. Furthermore, it helps me later in my career to understand the meaning of leadership and how the sharing responsibility and working together could bring the success to our endeavour. To conclude, solo sport can bring proud and honour to individuals but sports which played in teams teach people the meaning of working together which will improve the community in the future."}
{"text": "Some people strongly argue that money has to be shared for other ways. In contrast, it is necessary to invest money for developing the technology for space exploration. Although there are some benefits to spend money for space exploration, I believe the money should be spent for a disparity of wealth and environment. Initially, developing the technology for space exploration is necessary to some extent. For example, if people found a drastically innovative resource on another planet that takes the place of current resources, specifically, fossil fuel, and wood. People do not need to take care of limited resources on the earth any more. In addition, improving technology will cause to people's convenience on earth as a result. For example, recently some scientists are planning to launch a space rocket as a transport system on earth. hat it takes only two hours between New York and Shanghai by rocket. On the other hand, there are a lot of problems on earth. Especially, in developing countries, people are suffering from poverty while in developed countries waste massive food. In addition, even in developed countries, the disparity of wealth has been widening. Therefore, the money which is spent on space exploration should be used for all people's lives more safely around the world. Developed countries must have many options to give a hand to developing countries. For example, it must be effective to provide infrastructure, agriculture, and sharing clothing and food that are about to dispose of in developed countries. Finally, including my opinion, people can not choose their own nationality. This means that people who were born in a developing country and need to be suffered from poverty are definitely unfair. Therefore, the money is spent on space exploration partially spend for developing countries. As a result, the disparity of wealth will not be wider and people will be able to live with the same quality of lifestyle as developed countries to some extent."}
{"text": "For many years, the traditional teaching and learning (T&L) approach, i.e., having a teacher disseminating knowledge to a group of students in a classroom, is dominent over the world. With the advancement of information and communication technology, new learning approaches have been proposed and adopted. For example, students can now use computers to surf the internet to find information or knowledge they would like to study. Moreover, a number of pre-recorded education contents are now available online to provide classes/tutorials to learners. It is expected that this tradition T&L approach will not exist by 2050. Would it be true? There is no doube that there is an increasing number of T&L approaches due to emergence of new technologies. Together with the new approaches, we see there is a shift of the role of teachers these years, not only as one who is responsible to disseminate knowledge, but also a faciliator of learning. Teachers provide proper directions to students during their study, where current technology is not able to offer. Some people say the artificial technology is a threat, but still the accuracy of providing suggestions to students is not very high. Moreover, human teachers are able to provide emotional support to students. Studying is not just a robotic process of human beings. Students may encounter difficulties during the learning process and feel frustrated, which will eventually affect their progression in study. Human teachers could be more aware on this situation, not by the numeric assessment results, but the emotional behaviour of the students in the classroom, and provide prompt and proper counselling support and advice to the students. Also, it is still well-known that computers, even with AI, are weak in creating new knowledge. In the university setting, other than teaching the conventional knowledge, professors would disseminate their new research findings to the students in the class, with discussion among the students, inspiring them to the unexplored areas. This T&L process can only be effective when it happens in a classroom setting. In conclusion, technology may alter the way how we teach and learn. In spite of this, human teachers are also adaptive and certain roles of the teachers cannot be replaced by other tools or machines. Therefore, I believe that the tradition classroom T&L setting cannot be replaced completedly in the future."}
{"text": "Classical music is one of the oldest artistic samples of our history. However, the young people of the new generations do not appreciate this kind of music. I believe that governments should encourage young people to learn more about classical music and I will support my stand with valid arguments in the following paragraphs. First of all, the main reason behind the little interest of young people in classical music is the impact of globalization in music and arts. That is because people have the opportunity to know more about multiple things without leaving their homes. However, all this knowledge is only superficial and arts, more specifically classical music, is diminished by the big international industry of music. For instance, reggaeton music, despite the fact that its lyrics are often misogynous, is the most popular style of music these days. Another reason is that children and young people have less interest in cultural matters than in the past because governments do not invest in culture and arts. In most countries, investment in culture has been drastically reduced and young people have no access to classical music concerts and much less a musical instrument that has a huge cost. Consequently, governments should encourage young people to learn more about classical music and the arts. To summarise, this essay has examined the idea of classical music and why young people do not have an interest in this kind of music. As far as I am concerned governments should take responsibility in this matter and invest more money in culture and classical music encouraging young people to learn more about this kind of art."}
{"text": "The responsibility for providing funds for retirement is incredibly important and something that is often overlooked by younger people. Some believe it is the responsibility of the individual to plan for this, but others feel it is the responsibility of the state.People who believe that the state should be responsible for funding retirees, base their argument on the fact that in most countries, people pay taxes and social charges to the government. This money, they argue, should also go towards the provision of a pension for the person paying the tax. In addition, those who have very small or no income, pay little or no tax and do not have the ability to provide for themselves. The government, therefore, in its role of caring for the population, has an obligation to pay a pension and provide other social benefits, such as medical treatment.Many others, however, feel that it is the responsibility of individuals to fund their own retirements. As adults, they argue, people should be able to set aside and invest money throughout their lifetime, so that they can retire with few financial worries. In many countries the government has legislated a framework allowing and encouraging citizens to save up and accumulate sufficient funds for the period after their working years have ended.I neither agree nor disagree with the statement, but rather my opinion takes in parts of both arguments. I feel that people should be responsible for saving money to fund their retirement, but I also feel that individuals who have not had the chance to do so should be supported by the government out of taxes. In my view, therefore, it is wrong to say that governments have no obligation to help people in this area. Governments are there to support the entire population of their countries, which includes the poorer elements of society."}
{"text": "Rules and laws are important for society to functioning well in right path, if people do whatever they want freely in regular life then it might lead society to malfunction. This essay will argue why I completely reckon that laws are entirely needed for uplifting of civilisation. There are plethora of reasons why rules and laws have implication of lifestyles. First and foremost reason is that, crime, accidents and environment. If there are not certain rules about crime then people definitely do many criminal activities in each and every place , so other persons do not fell secure and safe. If people have freedom for whatever they want to do then , it will very dangerous for society as well as environment. Secondly, young generation could not differentiate what is right or wrong without the teaching of rules. For example, if official authorities could freely get implicated in money laundering from the national budgets and not encounter any punishment , then possible results in the political, economic and social turmoil in the country. Moreover, if there are no traffic rules then the situation of roads will not be imagined by anyone. The drugs are legal in countries then it is mainly effect on young generation's future and they will never know about right things. Pollution is only controlled by the Government's rules. If there are no any rules then human can not imagine the pollution level in the air. On the contrary, some people think that, rules and laws are unnecessary for their rights. If people aware about, what is good or bad for society, environment and themselves then it is not issue about laws and rules. However, many persons really can not understand about rules , so the Government made for people's peace and safety. Regulation is key that perfectly handle people's life in particular manner. To put in a nutshell, I pen down saying that, rules and laws are essential for the functioning of society. If citizens are given freedom to do whatever they like, then they will not only fall into bad habits but also creat confusion and nuisance in society as well as nation."}
{"text": "Modern children are suffering from the diseases that were once considered to be meant for adults only. Obesity is a major disease prevalent among children. What are its causes and what solutions can be offered?Nowadays, the increasing rate of overweight children and adults is a worldwide health issue. Obesity is a major problem which is increasing day by day in children. There are various reasons behind it. This essay will discuss the causes of obesity and offer some solutions.The first cause of obesity is junk food. It is often seen that mostly children are fond of burgers, pizzas, noodles and . These types of foods are easily available to them in school canteens. Children love to purchase chips, , ice-cream for lunch. Moreover, in this modern era, parents are working and they do not have time to cook at home. Parents often buy dinner for their children instead of preparing food at home. This calorie-rich diet is making children obese. This problem can be solved by teaching children to cook healthy foods for themselves and banning junk foods and fizzy drinks in schools. This diet can be replaced by milk, juice and fruits for lunch.The second cause of obesity is . It is true that the use of computers and television is increasing children. They spend most of their time watching television or playing video games on a computer. This technological advancement has reduced the level of physical activity in this specific age group. This issue can be resolved by encouraging children to do physical exercises. Parents can take their children to park to encourage playing with friends. Furthermore, schools can add sports in their curriculum to maintain physical fitness in their students.To sum up, it is clear that main causes of obesity are unhealthy eating and not enough physical activities. This ailment can be prevented and treated by healthy eating and physical exercises."}

But what makes education key factor for the development of a countryWe must acknowledge that education is something that we all need. The differences are just what we learn. Mostly the limited educational horizons of poor and less educated people have more to deal with their personal situation than with problems of bigger effects on a country. Attending school is sometimes too expensive and it does not feed a family.Nevertheless there must be a reason for education. For me it looks like some countries have realized that Education is the key for the globalization process. If we take India for example we can see that a change in the educational system had changed the economy of the country. country has changed from a poor region to a high potential for IT knowledge.In regard to this fact of education seriously and offer it to a wide range of people.

{"text": "Public health has become an increasingly pressing issue in the modern world, with many populations facing rising rates of obesity, diabetes, and other diet-related diseases. This has led to a debate as to whether governments should establish nutrition and food choice laws for the betterment of public health or if it solely falls on individuals to make wise choices. In my view, everyone should take ownership of their diet and assume responsibility for their health because it is the right choice.The argument for government-imposed nutrition and food choice laws is that they could help prevent people from making unhealthy choices which could lead to more serious illnesses down the line. For example, government regulations could limit the amount of sugar or fats allowed in food products, especially those marketed to children, and impose taxes on unhealthy snacks like chips and candy bars. This approach would also benefit those who lack the knowledge about healthy food, necessary to make informed decisions. By providing clear guidelines on what foods are healthy, and by taxing the unhealthy options higher, the government would steer individuals away from unhealthy options.However, there are also some valid arguments against governmental intervention. These types of regulations infringe upon individuals’ right to choose what they put in their bodies. After all, everyone should be free to make lifestyle choices for themselves. Additionally, there may not be enough evidence to suggest that overly restrictive regulations would have beneficial effects on public health outcomes in the long run. Since people’s love of unhealthy food is often considered an addiction, it is unlikely that a higher price or other warnings would be enough to deter individuals from purchasing unhealthy food items.In conclusion, while there can certainly be benefits associated with implementing nutrition and food choice laws at a governmental level, ultimately it should still come down to personal choice and responsibility as far as one’s diet is concerned. Governments should instead focus on providing citizens with better nutrition education, so that they can make better informed decisions about what they consume. This way, they can receive the information they need while still having autonomy over their own diets and lifestyles."}
{"text": "Many people believe that newspapers play a pivotal role in shaping the way we think. There are numerous ways in which this affects our society, and I believe that this influence is mostly negative.Newspapers have long been a source of valuable information that has kept societies abreast of the latest happenings in the world. Since the average citizen has minimal knowledge about the information in expert analysis articles, well-established newspapers are powerfully poised to form public opinion through attention-grabbing images and carefully worded commentary. This leaves the reader no choice but to trust the accuracy of what they have read.Sadly, unbiased objectivity, which used to be the core idea behind journalism, seems to be a thing of the past. The arrival and spread of social media platforms has caused a gradual decline in print media subscriptions and their circulation, since readers tend to favor the internet and social media to stay informed about current affairs. This gave rise to a worrying trend of newspapers using sensationalist and controversial tactics to improve their sales. As a result, the constant barrage of bad news has led to a society that sees itself as more vulnerable and powerless than ever. To make matters worse, there are plenty of well-documented instances where newspapers have been used to spread false propaganda which is usually politically motivated.All in all, although newspapers are our lifeline to the world around us, the recent trend of publishing misinformation has had a mostly negative impact on readers. It is my hope that newspapers will go back to publishing impartial accounts of the latest news in the future."}

There are people who think that it is important to enrich mind with cultural activities such as reading books and doing word puzzles. On the other hand, there are those who suggest that leisure time is made to relax the mind. I believe that a balance between the two extreme views is the better solution. It is very important to give to coltivate our mind with culture. Reading a book, listen to classical musing, play games in which problem solving tricks should be sold is a funny way to spend your time and at the same time exercise the brain. To spend 15 minutes playing a game in which you have to solve math problems or doing world puzzles can be considered as the mental counterpart of the physical workout. To read a book had always been considered as the best way to learn without studying. Another interesting way in which the brain should be trained is by playing an instruments. To focus on some activities that will encourage the development of your skills and more stimuli on your brain is surely one of the best way to spend a part of your leisure time. On the other hand, it is also important to rest. Also your brain need a break. While it is easy to rest your body by sitting on the sofa it is not equally easy to stop your brain and to give to it a break. Listening to classical music, listening to the sounds of the nature, to have a nice walk, do meditations are some ways in which you can rest your mind. Even if it will be time in which the brain is on pause, some positive effect will be noted. Indeed, after only 30 minutues the brain will be recharged and full of energy. In conclusion, I believe that a balance between intellectual activities and total rest of the brain will be the best solution to give to the mind both stimuli and time to recharge itself. Although the positive effects that will be obtained by spending leisure time in activities that improve the mind, the brain like a computer need sometimes to be put in a standby mode, even if just for a very brief period."}

Some people are tend to always make changes in their lives, thinking it is a good thing. However, other people think in the opposite way, and prefer to spend their lives with the same everyday routine. The both opinions have a reasonable logic, and I will try to describe these perspectives. On the one hand, avoiding changes make people's lives stable, and secure the comfort zone, which is not an easy thing to achieve. There are many books and training from psychologists and business coaches providing the phylosophy of doing the same things and keeping little traditions to structure the personality, focus on the right things, and have a plan for every day. Undoubtely, it helps to clear the mind, and keep yourself in safe in some ways from the rapidly changing life. On the other hand, history proves that progress in development is caused by changes human activities. Of course, permanent changes in life means the lack of stability, nevertheless does it mean, that there is no progress? The main point of this perspevtive is not to try everything that could effect positively or negatively, but to try to find a new aspects for personal grow, or get out form the comfort zone and chalenge yourself. To sum up, the both opinions have their own benefits and drawbacks, but the strategy of changes in life dirictly depend on the type of people's character.

{"text": "It is certainly true that many people around the world find their lives dominated by the work that they have to do. This is shown when you realise how people’s work, and how much time, effort and resources they devote to it, is often the subject of conversation.Most people depend on their jobs to generate an income to pay for their lives’ necessities and luxuries, and so work can naturally become a dominating focus. As this is an important part of nearly everyone’s everyday life, it can seem that people’s lives are indeed becoming more influenced by their jobs. Whether this emphasis on work is more significant now than in previous years is debatable. In many developed countries around the world, there are procedures in place to help people with finding work, providing unemployment benefits, ensuring education, and offering pension payments. In times past, these provisions were not in place and a job or business was required to provide the necessary income.Therefore, in spite of increases in the cost of living in many places around the world, it can be argued there is actually less pressure than in previous years to keep one’s job and perform well at it. This, in turn, would lead to people’s lives being less influenced by their jobs today. It is also true that in the past, people were as responsible and focused on doing well in their responsibilities as today and so, in this respect, the people of the past would be equally dedicated to their work as people are today.While I agree that people’s lives today are often dominated by their jobs, I feel that the current situation is not necessarily worse than before.

{"text": "Nowadays in many countries women have full time jobs. Therefore, it is logical to share household tasks evenly between men and women. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement?Nowadays an ever-increasing number of women work full time, and in this reality it is widely believed that house chores should be shared between men and women equally. I strongly agree with this statement.One of the reasons for sharing housework between is to promote gender equality. A stereotype that has existed a long time is that females ought to stay home, taking care of the family once they got married. This includes looking after the children and doing all of the housework, which is fairly labour-intensive. However, this approach could have quite a few disadvantages. It would render women less able of keeping abreast of what is happening in the job market, thus forming a lifestyle where they might find it arduous to step into the society again. To avoid this, many women are willing to get back into the workforce soon after their maternity leave, and once they do, it makes sense that their husbands should share part of the household chores, to fulfill their family responsibilities.Nevertheless, we cannot be oblivious several drawbacks of this trend. One potential downside is that men are less experienced in dealing with household tasks. This is because many seldom take an active role in doing housework, according to customs of many countries. As a result, they may end up doing household tasks in a less than perfect way, which could contribute to some unnecessary quarrels between partners, hindering their family bond. However, the likelihood of this happening isn’t very high, because wives can offer some tips or guidance to their husbands when they learn how to share house chores such as mopping floors or doing laundry.To sum up, although some conflicts might be triggered when equally sharing the duties of household tasks, the benefits of this trend are relatively oblivious."}

Regrettably . many people suffer form disadvantages situtaions nowdays like losing jobs or money ,they find themselves have no energy or motive to contiune and to help their families . As a result of that poverty propagates in some society and usually accompany with low level availability of education .

To deal with this, many people feel that a small proportion of everyone’s income should be used to aid the homeless and poor. This could create more opportunities and change the lives of many disadvantaged people for the better.Though there are certain facilities such as shelters and soup kitchens to aid the poor and homeless, it is clear that this is not enough. In the U.S. alone, a very developed country in itself, nearly two million people are homeless. These facilities can lend a helpful hand; however, they do not help eradicate the problem. Those people who are homeless or poor can have trouble finding jobs, or, if they are lucky to gain employment, the pay may not be enough to support them and their families.If a small percentage of everyone’s income was used to help build more aid facilities and fund organisations to help the homeless and poor, the suffering of many people could be alleviated. However, this is not a perfect world, and taxes are high enough for many people. A similar argument could be that a portion of the taxes already paid to the government should then be set aside for this cause, but of course government funds are usually stretched to breaking point as it is, as governments have so many financial responsibilities already.Though the fundamental idea that people should pay a small percentage of their income to help the homeless and poor is admirable, it is unlikely that enough people would agree to it.

Others say that experiences as a teenager, especially at school, are more influential. In the following paragraph, I will discuss both view and give my opinion. On the one hands, There has a research that bad experience in children before begining at school, especcially in family, will become unforgettable deep heart. For example, Children who live with strict parents and has aggressive punishment when children doing littie wrong things. In the future, Children will tend to aggressive and feeling they has not received a love from family. This research surely reasonnable because family is an important factor of social life. On the other hands, There have an opinion even if children was velvet glove when raised with family. However, Especially in adolescent, Friend and teacher can infleuence as same as family because teenagers spend more time at school that with family as a reason learning in classroom more than primary school and have a more group work with friend. Thus, If teenager prefer to close with a good student (not smoking or drinking alcohol / invite classroom friends travel education museum in weekends or holiday), Parents can make sure that your child will mature to standard adults. In conclusion, In my opinion, Children would be infleuenced by family before begining at school.

{"text": "Travelling today is simple to the extent that within twelve hours one can travel from Europe to Singapore, crossing nearly the whole globe. Based on this simplicity, tourism has changed significantly over the years. While in the past a family would be proud to drive two hours to a lake, many families now think nothing of travelling to the far side of the world. This also has a downside as increased pollution is a result. Extra taxes on flights or accommodation have therefore been offered as a solution so as to increase the cost of tourism and reduce its popularity.No matter what major transportation is used, travelling creates pollution. To decrease the amount of pollution caused by tourism, the tourism industry itself would have to be weakened. If these increased taxes are based on travelling distance, people would be more willing to stay closer to their home country, as for many even a slight increase would mean that their planned holidays would be too expensive. Accommodation taxes would raise holiday costs no matter the distance travelled. Therefore, if increased taxes were levied on travel and accommodation, tourism and therefore pollution would decrease.On the other hand, the main transport methods that would be impacted by imposing extra taxes would be communal ones, such as planes, trains and buses, and increasing the taxes would also impact non-tourists. Also, holidays are a vital part of ordinary people’s lives, as they escape from work and stress, and get to spend valuable time with their families. Stopping people travelling would greatly impact some simple pleasures of ordinary life.In conclusion, while tourism impacts the environment significantly, simply introducing extra taxes on transport or accommodation is a drastic measure. It could be more valuable to change the methods of transportation to decrease pollution, instead making people stay close to home."}
{"text": "Human beings are facing many challenges nowadays. Poverty is always an critical topic among countries, especially the poverty in developing countries. Developed countries frequently offer financial support to poor countries but the poverty still exist. Experts are arguing that developed countries should consider other solutions to help solve the poverty issue. I believe this is a much better direction compare to money support only. Money is essential to many factors like food, contruction and hospital. With money provided by developed countries, govenment can improve the inforstructure, supporting poor family with food, building more houses for the poor people, builing more schools to support children's education, which is critical for people to get out of poverty. But money cannot solve everything. The poverty caused by many reasons like lacking of resource and experienced governor. None of them could be solved by simply offering money to the goverment. Besides, money could cause a bad habit to the governor, they may reply on the financial support too much. If the financial support ended someday, which could happen anytime in the current circurmestance, it will cause big trouble again. Devevloped countries should focus on a sophicated solution instead of just providing money. For example, they can help poor countries to build manufacturing industry, and give certain subsides for the customer who buy directly from them. Developed countries also can send experienced instructor to help governer in poor countries build a better government system to improve the efficiency of governance, authority of justice, to make sure company feel safe to invest in these developing counties, which could have a long term benifit for the people there. Overall, I am agree that money could help to solve the poverty but without other support from different functions, it may not the best solution for poverty."}
{"text": "Today’s society overwhelmingly depends on products made from fossil fuels. Most people would initially think about fuel for transport, but of course, fossil fuels are part of most of the fabric of life around us, from the plastics on our furniture to the pavements that we walk on. Changing our reliance on these resources can have various consequences; however, I believe that overall the society will benefit from finding viable alternatives for them.Depending on whether eco-friendly alternatives are developed, the positive effect on transport and the reduction of the associated pollution will be significant. Exhaust fumes from motor vehicles, planes and ships decrease air quality and contribute to global warming and the greenhouse effect. People’s health and the health of the planet will surely improve without these industries relying on fossil fuels. It could be that a type of transport crisis could develop as a result if society can no longer provide the power to transport so many individuals to where they want to go. This, however, does not have to be a bad thing, as it could force society to use alternative solutions, such as transport sharing and public transport development. The change in mind set has already begun. Some countries have already committed to having fossil fuel free transport and more cities are banning private vehicles from the centre of cities.Another positive development would be that more time and money would have to be put into developing renewable sources of energy, such as wind power, solar power, hydropower and tidal power. Technologies would improve and be more efficient and again, the world would use fewer sources of energy that cause pollution. This development can also be seen today, with many governments committing to proportions of their power needs coming from renewable resources.I, therefore, strongly agree with the statement that the changes from reducing reliance on fossil fuels will be positive. The only caveat is that society will need to have developed alternative sources of power rather soon, in order to avoid an energy crisis."}

{"text": "There is no doubt that these days student's punishment decreased in most schools. Some people believe that physical punishment is important to improve behaviour. While others totally disagree with that. In this essay, I am going to discuss both views and draw my personal conclusion. In terms of people who agree with the student's punishment, they think that students need it to improve their attitude and to be good at school. To illustrate, when teachers physically punish students, Students will follow their instructions and avoid doing mistakes. In addition, other students will be carefule when they think to do any wrongs to avoid the punishment. So that will lead to seeing students who behave well and do no mistakes. However, some people believe that using corpral as a physical punishment has negative effects on the students. Firstly, students who face physical ounishment from their schools will have many psychological issues like fear, low self confidence, and isolation. Secondly, theses students will hate going to school and continuing their education in the future due to this punishment. For example, students will think of school as a scary place instead of thinking of it as an education site. So it is very normal that they are going to avoid going there. In conclusion, althogh some people agree with using corporal punishment, several people have their reasons to disagree with that. I believe that using corporal punishment or any kind of punishment with students at scool nowdays is unethical practice and should be avoided since there are a lot of ways to teach students to not do the wrong things."}

It has threatened the domination of spreading news of the traditional media, and, I would say, is about to take control.We can find everything we want on the Internet – the latest news, books, songs, movies, cartoons… . With the radio, we can merely hear. Compared to a newspaper, the radio and TV can provide the latest information. For instance the breaking news of the Americans’ attacking Iraq was immediately online, as well as that the Twin Towers of New York were destroyed on September 11, 2001. However, we just cannot .The Internet is a way of getting information, as long as your mobile phone is connected or you possess a laptop. When I am a vehicle, I usually have my cellphone connected to the Internet, then browse through what in the past few hours, or log in MSN to begin a conversation with my friends. Reading a newspaper is also a good way to kill time, but for me, a youngster, it is not so modern as “surfing online while commuting”.The traditional media will never disappear, though the Internet has taken a big advantage the competition. And definitely, there is still a long way for the Internet to go. , the Internet benefits me the most, and I highly appreciate it."}
{"text": "The benefits of walking are numerous, and experts recommend it as a good way to keep healthy and fit. Despite this, the number of people who walk on a daily basis is on the decline. The reasons for this are manifold, but there are also several solutions that may help people walk more.Lack of time is the most common reason people cite for not engaging in any form of physical activity. These days most people have hectic schedules that involve juggling their work and home responsibilities. As a result, they are often too exhausted or pressed for time and therefore opt for faster and more comfortable forms of transport, such as cars, bikes or public transport. Another major reason for the reduced number of pedestrians on the roads is a lack of safety. Most full-time workers are not free to walk during the day, and will skip it in the evenings or early morning hours, if they do not feel safe enough to do so.Fortunately, there are quite a few solutions to this issue. One is making walkers safe, which means the government should ensure that there are enough sidewalks and streetlights available in every suburb, so that pedestrians can walk or jog safely whenever time allows. Another useful option is to create special walking tracks and parks in neighbourhoods where people can get some much-needed exercise in the evenings. The added benefit of promoting the healthy lifestyle and walking in the community makes this solution even more attractive.To conclude, the pressures of daily life and lack of safely while walking reduce the popularity of this healthy practice. Governments can reverse this trend by creating more green spaces for people to walk in and addressing their safety concerns."}
{"text": "For centuries, artworks have been titled  'Work of Art' based on their extraordinary qualities. However, some people argue that nowadays, the standards are decreasing and the labelling of substandard artworks as 'masterpieces' has become ubiquitous. The upcoming essay will discuss why I agree that original paintings are being neglected while usual ones are being praised. Firstly, the superficial nature of humans is responsible for this change. These days, people do not see the meaning behind the painting or the message the artist is trying to convey rather they buy those paintings which are popular and contemporary. To illustrate it further, in art auctions it can be seen that when one person bids on one painting, no matter whether it is good or bad, others also start putting their money on it. Thus it is clear that normal art forms are winning prizes due to public attention. Secondly, some artists might bribe the organizers of exhibitions to promote their canvas. Indeed, there have been some recorded instances when artists were caught while signing up deals to increase the sales of their work. If a certain artwork receives publicity then it is impossible that it would not have an influence on the public. This type of promotion skews a person's opinion about a certain picture and so are forced to think about purchasing it, leaving behind original ones. Therefore, it is apparent that the diabolical activities of painters are responsible for their works being labelled as masterpieces. To conclude, the maintenance of social position and influence of painters are the prime causes for the popularity of ordinary artworks and the negligence of true works. Hence I agree with the given statement."}
{"text": "Environmental problems are clearly something that is often discussed in today’s world. One part of the society claims that individuals should change their habits and lifestyle to improve the ecological situation. Others, on the other hand, believe that this issue should be solved on the governmental level. This essay will discuss both sides of the argument and my perspective will be offered.It is hard to deny that human kind is responsible for the current environmental situation, and it seems impossible to achieve any noticeable result in this field without the participation of vast majority of individuals. For instance, a simple lifestyle change such as introducing the separation of household rubbish can make recycling projects more convenient and efficient. Moreover, consumers can reduce their usage of plastic items and, in turn, less plastic waste will contaminate the environment.However, many people still feel that the government has more tools to prevent environmental changes. One option that the authorities have is to discourage citizens from using personal vehicles by charging high taxes and additional fees. Moreover, politicians usually have access to resources to educate people about environmental problems and promote the most important ecological projects on all levels, ranging from special courses at schools to TV shows and websites related to this topic. Furthermore, it is a key responsibility of the government to protect the environment by spending state funds on research and modern equipment. Countries where legislation protects the ecology, for example Norway, have achieved visible results and overcame most environmental problems.In conclusion, I believe that a combined approach will work best to prevent or reverse environmental changes. A contribution of every individual is just as important as the intervention from the government in order to fix existing issues and save our planet for future generations."}
{"text": "Sugar-based drinks has become a popular beverage amongst the people especially in today's generation, the millenials. This essay will outline possible reasons on why people are consuming such drinks and also some ways for them to consume less. To start, sugar is the main component of this beverage. Study shows that consuming this can boost a person's energy levels. Hence athelete ae addicted to this refreshments such as energy drinks. Furthermore, this can increase mental alertness especially to working individuals. For instance, not all workers has the capability to maintain their energy at work, sometimes they tend to get sleepy leading them to buy sugary drinks like milk teas. Not only that, advertisement can also be a factor. For example, young people gets curious whenever new sugared drinks is advertised especially if this is shown by their favorite icon. Lastly, consumer's lack of knowledge and misinformation regarding their product as evident by the coca cola lawsuit. Although it may be difficut for people to stay away from this. There are ways that can help them drink less. One solution is for government to impose a price hike. Meaning high price can discourage them to buy this drinks. Second, just like alcohol, buying sugar-based drinks at malls or grocery store should have time limit. For instance, whoever will buy and sell beyond the allotted time should pay a fine. Also, Educating the public about the health issue of drinking too much sugar-based drinks should be prioritize. Finally, government should encourage company such as pepsiCo, and the Coca-cola company to be transparent of their nutritional facts. In conclusion, sugar-based drinks has become popular due to advertisements and society's thinking that it can replenish their energy levels. In contrast, goverment should take the first step educate and encourage individuals to mimimize drinking this."}
{"text": "The benefits of giving or not giving homework to children are often debated. Some people feel that children have enough work to do during one day whilst at school, whereas others feel that the more work set, the better.It is true that schools today place more and more demands and pressure on children. The competition to do well, to enter a good university and to get a good job is significant. This has led to the ideology that children should do as much schoolwork as possible in order to help their intellectual development. The argument, however, that more is better is not always valid. There comes a point, especially for a child, when more knowledge cannot be absorbed in a day. When a child has possibly 7 or 8 classes a day on different subjects, he or she is processing a lot of information already. To give more work to be done at home, therefore, would be pointless and even counterproductive. In addition to this, although it is important to be educated, childhood should also be a time when there is an opportunity to just play and enjoy unstructured time. Homework can significantly lessen the possibilities of doing this.On the other hand, it can be argued that there is a place for homework. If study at school is not overdone, the opportunity to look at work again and extend ideas can be an invaluable exercise. It’s easy to forget one thing that has been taught once, but if that concept is revisited a second time, the brain has time to reprocess and likely better understand and remember.It seems to me that there is a place for homework for today’s children. What must be remembered, though, is that homework needs to be limited to age-appropriate parameters, so that a balance can be struck between study and free time and relaxation."}

{"text": "Banning cars from the centre of various cities around the world has been a strategy to reduce pollution and encourage people to use public transport. It has had various positive effects for both individuals and for society as a whole.Banning cars from the centre of cities seems to be a very positive development. Fewer cars on the road means less pollution and fewer fossil fuel resources being used up. Although the effect on resources might be relatively negligible, it can create a newer way of thinking regarding the dynamics of transport within cities and this could be the most important benefit to society. Some people working in the centre of these cities may complain about inconvenience, but many would agree that this is a small price to pay.A reduction in the reliance of people on private vehicles is likely to encourage them to use public transport or even bicycles. Using public transport, especially the types that run on clean sources of power, will significantly raise air quality levels in cities, which will of course benefit everyone. The clean air could even further encourage the use of bicycles, which would in turn promote more healthy lifestyles and less obesity. This would contribute on an individual level to people’s well-being and a better and longer life, and on a societal level, it would lessen the strain on public health resources. Governments could encourage this by creating more bicycle lanes to make cycling easier and safer.In conclusion, it is clear that banning cars from the centre of cities is significantly beneficial. Better health and ecology, as well as improvement in longevity and well-being can benefit individuals and the entire society."}
{"text": "Nowadays celebrities make more money compared to people working in politics. This essay will look at the possible causes of this tendency and explain why, in my opinion, this is a negative development.There are two main reasons why celebrities generate more income than politicians. One of them is that with the advent of the Internet, there are more ways available for celebrities to earn money, such as online streaming services. For example, singing a song in a YouTube video with some advertisements enables them to easily make a few million dollars. Another cogent reason for this is the growing global concerns over excessively high remuneration for political leaders, which can easily lead to public discontent. In response to such criticism, many governments have decided to reform the reward system for lawmakers, sending their salaries on a downward trend.I personally believe that this development is relatively negative for several reasons, with the main one being the potential corruption scandals this issue can create. The enormous salary gap between celebrities and political leaders might discourage the legislators from putting in work or even motivate them to commit crimes such as money laundering. In addition, the relatively low salary for stressful jobs of governors may deter people with foresight on politics from becoming politicians. This is particularly undesirable because it would result in low level of citizens’ loyalty to their incompetent government, creating unstable society with more crime and other social problems.In conclusion, the fact that celebrities are paid more than political leaders now is caused by a wider variety of income sources available to them, and supported by the social norm that a politician should not be a profit driven professional. However, I believe this is a negative trend which may lead to more political corruption and less talented governments."}
{"text": "There are people who believe that the mixture of nationalities make faster the development of a country. Although, it could seem that an international environment could influence negatively the culture of a country, I believe that the exchange that is born from people coming from different places is essential in order to develop the social attitudes of the citiziens and to have new ideas and perspectives. The internationality of a country permits people to develop their social attitudes. To live in the same country with people who have originated in a different one require all of them to be open to discover now personal outlooks. They have to communicate between each other and also to respect the different cultural habits they have. This lead people to be more open-minded and ready to accept new changes. A country in which there are these features will develop from different point of view faster. Indeed, people will be already able to understand the flow of the new trends and they will be open to new economical and political choices. By contrast, in a country in which there is no way to interact with people who have a different nationality will be more difficult to understand the limit and the possibilities of their country. Although the tradition of the country will be preserved, people will be less accostumated to the change trying to mantain their traditional custums, even if uncorrect, as soon as they can. The political and economical assestment of these country will reflect the closeness of the population. For instance, they will be less concerned about the stability of the other countries and they will try to develop their own without caring of the international consequences. Furthermore, a country in which there are different people who comes from different places is one in which new ideas and perspectives can be develped. Indeed, workplaces will be encouraged in their development by the interaction between people who have different culture. In the general picture, the benefit of each single and small company will impact positively on the country itself and its economical status. To go further, people who have to interact with other foreign nationalities will be able to communicate with them and this means that they will be able to speak and understand other languages other than their mother tongue. The ability to be fluently in other languages, mostly in English, nowadays is essential for the develop of a country. The companies will be able to expand their trade. In conclusion, I completely agree with the idea that a country can develop faster its population is made of different nationalities. There will be advantages from the social and cultural perspective as well as from the economical and political point of view."}
{"text": "In this fast-moving age, with the development of education and modern technologies, people strive to have a secure job after graduating from colleges and universities. Despite their efforts, so many young adults in different parts of the world have a negative experience of finding a long-term job.It so happens that most colleges and universities focus on students’ academic performance much more than their practical skills. Unfortunately, many companies reserve permanent job opportunities for experienced applicants because there is no need to invest much in their training. Lack of practical experience in new graduates puts them at a disadvantage as far as companies are concerned. The situation is made worse by the abundance of advanced technologies that can easily replace human labor. Robots and computers work more efficiently and with higher precision than humans. That shrinks the pool of available job placements even more, as companies only need to hire highly educated and experienced staff.Fortunately, there is a number of solutions that can help inexperienced workers gain permanent employment. An obvious one is that universities could offer internships to their students, or arrange workshops in addition to classwork. This would help students to get training and experience in their respective fields. Also, the government could examine the demands of changing labor market and steer young people towards professions that will be popular in the coming years. Together with colleges and universities the government could create special awareness programs for graduates, providing them with an overview of various job offers and their benefits. This way students would be able to choose the right jobs for themselves.To sum up, lack of demand in the labour market and insufficient experience are two major reasons why many young people have trouble finding a permanent position. Helping them gain hands-on experience as part of their studies and educating them about career options early on is key to improving the employment outcome for them."}
{"text": "International sport events such as the Olympics and the World Cup tend to be the center of attention when they are held. While many people believe that being the location of the events can bring tremendous advantages to the host, others argue that the preparation does not worth the benefits. This essay will examine the opinions of both sides. To begin with, an international sport tournament leads to an abruptly economic growth as it attracts a large number of sports fans from all around the globe. Being the destination of these visitors, all hotels in the city and neighbouring areas can be fully booked and local businesses surrounding will be in turmoil to serve the tourists. For example, the Olympics usually caused all accommodations around the hosting areas to be occupied and therefore, the city can obtain additional income by setting up temporary accommodations. Nevertheless, these opportunities usually come with enormous prices. With the foregoing benefits, the hosting country needs to put enormous effort into preparation prior to the event. To elaborate, in order to welcome a countless amount of visitors, the country is required to invest in constructing, maintenance, and improvement of venues and various relevant locations. As a certain level of readiness and handling standards are expected from the fans, failing to meet the expectations can lead to negative reputations of the country. Furthermore, the hosting country will also have to bear the risks that may impact the event. For example, if there is any force majeure such as a pandemic, the event may be postponed or even cancelled. To conclude, the occurance of international sports events can bring significant devlopments to the host in an exchange of a great deal of investments and risks. Thus, the government must consider thoroughly before deciding to step in."}
{"text": "It is indeed true that digital resources today far outstrip what can be put and stored in print books. Almost any kind of book can now be accessed digitally and those that can’t be will soon be changed to a digital format. Some people, therefore, believe that libraries with print books are no longer needed.If one looks at this issue dispassionately, it seems far more logical that people now should only read books digitally. It only requires a single computer or electronic reader and an individual can have access to the history of literature and works on all other fields. The costs involved with setting, typing, printing and distributing print books would practically disappear and this would make things more convenient and much cheaper. An actual library building would be totally unnecessary, as all one would need would be a ‘virtual library’ as a website and all works could be accessed through this portal. There would not even be any need to leave the house to gain access to anything one needed. This would seem to be the most logical way of proceeding.Logic, however, is not always the best approach to everything. Print books have a long history with humanity and our relationship with real books is not something that can be changed overnight. Many people, including younger readers, feel that there is something special about having a book with real paper and needing to turn pages. There will therefore for the time being be a future for print books and libraries.Libraries will continue to be especially important, as not all older people use computers and e-readers as much as the younger generation. They will still want to read print books and the library is a cheap and convenient place to find them. In addition, if only a few books in print are available in the future, libraries might be one of the few places where they might be accessed. Another purpose that libraries serve is acting as community centres that organise events, education and childcare. Ironically, libraries also provide computers and Internet access for people who cannot afford their own.In spite of the seeming dominance to come of digital books, I feel that there is and will be a place for libraries with print books. This state of affairs might change in the future, but at present, they are important community resources."}

{"text": "In recent years, a variety of crimes and other violent news on television, in newspapers, as well as on the Internet report might have increased to a few decades ago. Although some people might be concerned these reports have adverse consequences, I disagree the news should be reported continuously. To begin with, some parents might be concerned that these reports might be harmful to their children. Children tend to be susceptible to any information, including enjoyable news, and heavy crime news. Therefore, some parents just hope their children watch some healthy news, such as entertainment, sports, and technological innovation news. On the other hand, some crimes, including violence, and murder cases should not diminish the volume of news. Recently, the Japanese media tend to hide the actual violent scene. In addition, reporters, and writers tend to explain the detail in the verbal report, or detail in letters. This news must be helpful for parents to prepare some ideas for their children in order not to be involved in some dangerous crimes. For example, parents recently give a cell phone to children to contact any time. In addition, the parents can observe where the children are 24/7 by taking advantage of GPS. Finally, Japan is one of the safest countries across the globe. Therefore, Japanese people tend to overrate the Japanese society that crimes, including violence, will never happen to our life. In contrast, looking at some reports of crimes and other kinds of violent news will be a great trigger to educate children in order not to be murdered, and avoid kidnapping by criminals. In conclusion, it is necessary to report crimes and other kinds of violent news for all people to prepare unpredictable future."}
{"text": "Generally, in our real lives, failure and successful events usually are seen in workplaces, sports and in families. Actually i completely disagree that the act of failing is caused by a lack of desire and motivation. There are many different factors which influence our failure and success. Firstly, the most recent event which affected significantly most of people's motivation, is the Covid-19 pandemic. The last two years there the number of business failure increased significantly due to lockdowns and victims by pandemic. For example the first lockdown in Europe happened in Italy in 2020, which restaurants, leisure facilities and shopping centres were obliged to close for more than one year. The consequence of this, was the loss of customers and the accumulation of debt, which led to many failures, because people had difficulties paying their bills and taxes. On the other hand, failure could happen if people has no desire to expand their horizons. For example many developed companies that accept paying their employees larger amount of money, this action could cause laziness to company's members, even they could be absent from work. All that happens because of complacency. Consequently this can amount in dismissal and ruin their job's career and reputation in terms of work experience. Taking all of this into account, failure it doesn't only depend on peoples' personality and behaviour, but is also caused by external factors, influencing dramatically people's lives in terms of profit."}

The problems they are experiencing happen not only at school, but also at home, and it seems that without adult guidance, our young generation will continue to struggle.Teenage years have never been simple, and many would agree that the amount of challenges has only increased with the passage of time. Bullying has been a problem for quite a while, and children and adolescents would have experienced it at school in the past, but then it would stop at home. At present, however, things have been made worse by social media penetrating the supposedly safe space of our teenagers. The unfortunate behaviour of their peers can now reach them even in their bedrooms, causing them constant distress.Another issue troubling many young people is the pressure to succeed by their families. Whether at school or at home, they often feel as if they are not smart enough, which creates overwhelm and despair. Understandably, their parents are pursuing a worthy goal of ensuring their children get a great start in life; however, many teens feel that they are failing their families when they don’t live up to their expectations. This often leads to dishonest and unethical behaviour, such as cheating on tests or plagiarising other students’ work. When uncovered, these incidents have a profound effect on young people’s future careers, not to mention their emotional well-being.It is hard to underestimate the importance of parental support to navigating life as a young person. From helping teens build a positive body image and self-esteem, to handling classmates’ difficult behaviour, to guidance where study is concerned, parents can make a world of difference. Talking to their sons and daughters about matters that worry them, listening and making non-judgmental suggestions are great ways to help. Getting a professional involved where necessary and engaging with teachers, councilors and coaches is another opportunity for parents to provide assistance. Last but not least, parents can make their children better and happier people by simply giving them unconditional love.To sum up, being a young person in the modern world isn’t easy. By banding together and paying careful attention to their teens, families can help them overcome any obstacles to becoming successful adults."}

Many poeple are enthusiastic with such innovation, while others are not as much interested. This essay will essentially provide a discuss of the topic, followed by a final opinion supporting the discussion. Purchasing items on the web is a tending thing to put into consideration. The huge tendency to get whatever basically required from a click of a finger is blessing for many. Such facility had enabled disabled people to get access to millions of global shopping markets with their varieties. In addition, it had proven its efficiency among the massive liquidity and momentum from overseas markets and local marketing agencies, in addition to the enormous numbers of online purchasers.

{"text": "It is important to experiance and learn certian kind of habits at younge age for children to develop them as they grow older. Growing vegetables and taking care of animals are two main practices children should develop at their younger age. In this essay I will discuss some disadvatages that would affect children during this process and explain why I feel that there are better advatages. The most significant advatage of learning to grow vegetables is that children will initally start to understand the importance of eating healthy and also the process of growing vegetables. In this case children will learn not to waste food and how hard and the effort it takes to grow these vegetables. It is important that we keep reminding children from their primary age so that they will remember and practice as they grow older. Taking care of animals is another important thing that children should learn in their primary , this will teach children to care for others and not be frighten of animals. Furthermore, they will learn to respect animals and love them. Some of the disadvantages of keeping animals is that some children has different types of allergies which will lead them to be more sick. However, some animals tend to be more dangerous than others. Another disadvatages is that when growing vegetables the compost and pestisides are dangerous to children or it might sometime be allergic to them as well. Insect bites during planting will also lead children to get sick. In conclusion it is important to learn how to grow vegetables and take care of animals at their younger age since they develop certain habits and learn more indeapth which will be helpful as they grow older. Eventhough, some argue that it is more riskier for children I believe that the advatages outweight disadvatages."}

Firstly, without knowing defectant's past, he could to throw everyone off the scent. Persons who are being accused of the crime usually try to soften their sentence. Tey are capable to lie about many things to avoid the prison. Secondly, the defectant can have criminal record in past, so with having access to accused's background the point about this could help in researching the dicision of the case. For this part, is also possible to mention than criminal persons could intentionally go to the prison for some common case such as steeling somebody's property, to avoid of punishment of anything more serious and horrible like murdering or unlegal human trafickking. and in thhis moment the defectant's past is mostly important than ever! Anothe reason why I agree with a jury should be given all the past facts are cases when the accused peron where slandered and because of missing few background details an innocent man might be convicted. In other words, in reason of unawarenes can interfere with judgement. On the other hand, any personal problems cannot be presented as strong argument for acquittal of a crime.

{"text": "Public health has become an increasingly pressing issue in the modern world, with many populations facing rising rates of obesity, diabetes, and other diet-related diseases. This has led to a debate as to whether governments should establish nutrition and food choice laws for the betterment of public health or if it solely falls on individuals to make wise choices. In my view, everyone should take ownership of their diet and assume responsibility for their health because it is the right choice.The argument for government-imposed nutrition and food choice laws is that they could help prevent people from making unhealthy choices which could lead to more serious illnesses down the line. For example, government regulations could limit the amount of sugar or fats allowed in food products, especially those marketed to children, and impose taxes on unhealthy snacks like chips and candy bars. This approach would also benefit those who lack the knowledge about healthy food, necessary to make informed decisions. By providing clear guidelines on what foods are healthy, and by taxing the unhealthy options higher, the government would steer individuals away from unhealthy options.However, there are also some valid arguments against governmental intervention. These types of regulations infringe upon individuals’ right to choose what they put in their bodies. After all, everyone should be free to make lifestyle choices for themselves. Additionally, there may not be enough evidence to suggest that overly restrictive regulations would have beneficial effects on public health outcomes in the long run. Since people’s love of unhealthy food is often considered an addiction, it is unlikely that a higher price or other warnings would be enough to deter individuals from purchasing unhealthy food items.In conclusion, while there can certainly be benefits associated with implementing nutrition and food choice laws at a governmental level, ultimately it should still come down to personal choice and responsibility as far as one’s diet is concerned. Governments should instead focus on providing citizens with better nutrition education, so that they can make better informed decisions about what they consume. This way, they can receive the information they need while still having autonomy over their own diets and lifestyles."}
{"text": "The debate over whether it is better to own or rent the property in which one lives is one that has strong supporters on each side. There are persuasive arguments for both points of view.One of the main advantages of renting a property is flexibility. Usually, a tenant only has to give a month’s notice before changing where he or she lives. If a property is owned and a change is needed, the property must be put onto the market and it is frequently a long and stressful process to get a sale completed. Sometimes, the wrong time of year or a bad market can mean that a sale is not possible. Another advantage of renting is that a large amount of a family’s capital is not tied up in the property. Property can cost hundreds of thousands of dollars and often a lot more. If one rents, this money can be spent on other things to help improve the family’s quality of life. If the property is on a mortgage, then the deposit, also often very large, is tied up in the property and the pressure of having to make substantial payments every month can cause a lot of stress.Owning a property does have various advantages, though. Even though people usually have to service a mortgage every month with payments, this money is then built up with the property. With renting, the money is lost to the landlord, but at the end of the term of the mortgage, the whole property is owned by the family. This makes the process of living in a property a type of investment. In addition, the property’s value often goes up after time, frequently creating a substantial profit. Owning the property where one lives can also create a sense of well-being and self-actualisation.The decision to whether one rents or owns the property in which one lives really boils down to individual preference. My opinion is that it is much more preferable to own a property, mainly because it creates a valuable asset for the family."}
{"text": "Throughout the history of education, learning a foreign language or languages has been a constant component. Of course, many people feel that this is really an unnecessary part of education for everyone, but this is not a point of view that I share.The opponents to learning a foreign language might argue that most people do not travel that often outside their own country. In addition to this, out of all the countries of the world, comparatively not many share the same language. Therefore, learning a foreign language will only be useful for the very limited time that one spends in a country where this language is used. For some people, the language might never be used in their entire lives. When one thinks about how much time and money are spent training language teachers, buying resources, going on trips and delivering lessons for such a negligible benefit, this would seem to be a very inefficient allocation of resources.However, the benefits of learning a foreign language go further than just the ability to use it from time to time on a holiday or business trip. Firstly, through learning one language, one gains an understanding to some extent of how all languages work. Thus, no matter where people might end up around the world, the knowledge of language can be of use. Secondly, with the study of a foreign language, one also opens oneself up to other cultures. This allows in turn an appreciation for different points of view and belief systems. With an ever-shrinking world due to globalisation, the ability to empathise and understand the people from other countries is vital to reducing conflict and creating a more tolerant society. Finally, quite simply learning languages is excellent for the improvement of general cognitive skills.It seems to me that learning a foreign language, therefore, is more than just gaining the ability to speak a few words of a foreign tongue. It is part of intellectual and social development and needs to be continued for everyone in today’s schools."}

{"text": "The cultural value of engaging with museums and art galleries is unquestionable; they exert a great deal of influence on our perception of the world. It is only reasonable to ponder whether or not these outlets of culture should concentrate their efforts on presenting the nation’s own art, and not that of other countries. In my opinion, there should be an attempt to strike a balance and put the objects of national art in the spotlight, while allowing the public to get acquainted with foreign artworks to a certain extent.If people were to only find sculptures and paintings by national artists in their local museums, that would have a number of positive effects, such as the fame the artists of that country would gain and the pride its citizens would feel for their fellow countrymen. It would promote patriotism and strengthen the image of the country in the eyes of its inhabitants. Local artists would also receive more financial assistance from the government as their works would generate a significant amount of interest, potentially resulting in further development of the local art. However, in order to evolve art needs fresh ideas, and without exposure to a wider range of creativity the world provides, the evolution of local arts may be hindered.People enjoy art because it appeals to their inner sense of beauty and triggers strong emotions, and whether the masterpiece that causes these feelings belongs to a local or foreign artist is irrelevant. Talent knows no geographical boundaries; therefore, the emphasis should be on how much joy or amazement the work of art brings, rather than on its origin. If that principle were to be followed, we would never have to choose between local and international art. Reducing our museums or galleries’ collections to local art works, in my view, would be harmful and go against the democratic nature of art.To sum up, it seems to me that a country has nothing to lose by allowing its people to admire art created elsewhere in the world. A conscious choice by the government to support local artists while hosting exhibitions from other countries could prove the most beneficial."}

{"text": "Councils are debating if building housing areas on expanded land is a better solution than providing taller dwellings. It might be an extremely complicated choice, considering the skyrocketing rise of number of people in the world and the change in prefering a walk-distance city. This essay will explore the optimal solutions for cities layout. Although the ideal solution might depend on what the cities are aiming for, under a generic point of view, it would be optimal to have dwellings compacted in a dimished size of land. The first justification is that cramping everything in a reduced area and growing tall allowes all the residents to reach shops and workplaces in dwindling time through walking, public transport or eco-friendly vehicles. Moreover, taking in account the overall incresing of population's density, with the creation of a taller layout, a sustainable market demand will be shown. Nowadays, the antiquated method of construct residences on a wider area of land is not feasible. In most locations, cities are running out of vacant lands, in fact many single houses are occupying vast areas for luxury amenities for a limited family, when a building can be erected accomodating many households. Furthermore, an implementation in infrustracture, such as roads and parking, will be needed. If individuals are not able to arrive to destination without a private car, due to long distances to cover, more highway will be required, therefore more lands is taken away for agglomerate of dwellings and business offices. To conclude, the world is shifting toward a highly populated areas, so that councils need to keep up to date with convinient cities layout, like skyscrapers rather than single houses, to ease people lifestyles and reduced citizens' footprint."}

There are people who believe that physical strength is the key for success, on the contrary, others think that mental strength is most important for being successful. While muscle and physical preparation are the main reason to overcome on weaker opponents. Mental strength, in my perspective, is the most important because provides something special and unbreakable that last longer and gives more than just muscle power. One the one hand, it is the physical strength. Which provides more energy for developing and performing better in sports, such as soccer, tennis, golf with better and precises strikes on the ball. Although, gives an important advantage on weaker opponents in therms of power, mobility and speed among others, for instance, boxing against a 20 pounds lighter fighter. In global, physical strength is a good and simple reason to overcome weaker athletes. On the other hand, it is the phychological factor or “the head”. Which deliver more reciliense and will to win in stress and critic situations, like the final match in the last set of a grand slam. Also, good mental state allows to compensate the strengh, muscle and energy of opponents by focalizing the attention on last longer, that is the case of runners in marathon and ultramarathons. In the end, menthal power deliver something special, not measurable and unbreakable that last longer than just physical power. In my opinion the most powerfull weapon that all athletes have is the mental strength, it is more powerful than any muscle, provides resilience to fatigue and focus in stressed times. In summary, physical strength provides advantage on many aspects of sports, such as energy, velocity and movement. Nevertheless, mental strength is the key to succes in high quality sportsmans"}

Overpopulation is one of the many global problems next to climate change, and poverty. In my opinion, the need to have children roots back to us being nothing more, but civilised animals. Animals have one goal above all; reproduce. This is why in many cultures, men and women who cannot have chlidren are seen as disabled, or sick. Nowadays, modern values changed our perspective, having children is often seen as a necessity for a happy, and successful life. It is important to recognise the problems the developed world faces. There is smoke in the air, plastic pollution everywhere, poverty in third world countries, and many other factors that make Earth a terrible place for many. Above all, the life we give birth to will have to eat, drink, and consume just like everyone else, using more and more of the already limited resources, generating more and more trash. Many people argue that the above mentioned points are a pessimistic and unrealistic. Humans have to reproduce, to keep the species from extintion. And truthfully the only way to do that, is to give birth as many kids as possible. This issue lies deep in our society; here in Hungary, a family is rewared almost 30000 USD if they have 3 or more kids. This means that many people have children because they get money for it, and they are also seen socially accepted. I believe modern day intelligence goes further than IQ points and money earned. We have to recognise the problems created, overpopulation being one of them. While I do not believe that we should not have kids, I think there should be careful planning involved and self-reflection before giving birth to new life."}

In this essay, I will discuss two opposite attitudes of modern people to some traditional celebrations and give example and some advice to the issue. On the one hand, it seems that the majority of people does not care about the reason of holidays, they are ready to enjoy them without any concrete reasons. First of all, that happens usually because of the fact that many people overwork and do not live in their work-life balance, so they are very glad to have additional day-off. The second explanation to the issue can be that people follow some traditions from ancient times, so some of those traditions became as a routines, that the basic meaning could be forgotten during the times. But nations continue folloving some customs just because they got used to them, even if they do not remember the main purpose of the celebration. The third reason to that can be that young generation do not understand some of their ancestors traditions, so they just accept some festivals from their predecessors as days when they are able to make their lives brighter and enjoy themselves. On the other hand, there are exist people who know the basics of festivals and familiar with the hystory of traditions in their countries. Such kind of people usually consern about their traditions and pay more attantions to some specific atributes of festivals, which can be symbolise health, wealth, success, or maybe femily hapiness, et cetera. In my opinion, it would be beneficial if the main purposes of some, especially ancient, traditions, to be explained to others. First of all, people would become familiar with some old customs and maybe partly could understand the reasons why their ancestors used some kind of colors and accesuars during that holidays. Additionally, people would know better the histories of their countries and share those knowledge with younger generations. So, the youth could not only enjoy themselves during celebrations, but also become more intelligent about traditions in their homelands. To sum it up, it is widely spread attitude on holiday organisation as to only having entertainment, dancing, and having wonderful moods during those days. However, if the history of festivals and ancient traditions is spread properly, people become more wisdom about the main reasons of those celebrations in their countries."}
{"text": "The amount of waste people produce can be quite shocking, with every person generating kilograms of rubbish in a single day, and all this can be difficult to manage. This has given some people the idea that there should be a limitation on the amount of rubbish produced per household; however, opinions are divided as to whether this would be the the most effective option.Having a limitation on the amount of waste produced sounds like a fine solution to a significant problem, with over two hundred and fifty million tons being generated in 2016 by the U.S. alone. Taxing households that break limits would push people to produce less waste and make them more mindful of what can be recycled or composted. However, forcing people to produce less waste might not be attainable.Households produce as much waste as they need to live their lifestyles. The waste people generate is only a result of the products they purchase, and will most likely wish to continue to purchase. Taxing people may be a cause of resentment, with many of them already struggling to pay their usual bills. In addition, if people produce more than they are allowed, this will encourage littering and dumping, so that they are not caught with more waste than entitled, and this in turn will damage the environment.Though controlling the amount of waste produced is important, there could be other ways of encouraging lesser output. In my opinion, governments should encourage composting and recycling, which will also reduce wasted material. People should also be more aware of what waste they produce and how it can be reduced. An education drive on these issues would perhaps be more likely to succeed in reducing rubbish than imposing limitations."}

In this essay, I disagree that lucrative wealth makes citizens careless about anything because they are developing their country. Additionally, I will talk about how economic wealth had changed the life of people in their countires. There are numerous reasons why economic wealth is prominent even though if the country is rich they could be richer. Firstly, the higher the remunerative wealth makes life easy for citizens. Because now it is difficult to find jobs, therefore, these profitable companies could afford you one in your rich country. Some people may believe that people would be careless, that is not true. Because people are the main purposes of making this wealth, and they also want to develop their country and make it more knownable for the rest of life. Moreover, living in a rich country gives a priority for a good life. Furthermore, the increase of economic wealth changes the view of other countires and citizens. Having a high economic wealth could change the life of people. All of the people are greedy no matter what you do they want more and more, therefore, people are developing their county to have a high salary and live a tranquil life. To conclude, having an increase of economic wealth in a country changes the lives of citizens. People are trying to develop the countries to make it more knownable and a prominent figure in life. Meanwhile, people are greedy they want more that what they deserve so by the increase of lurcative wealth they could get higher than what they deserve."}
{"text": "The fashion industry today is an important component of society and people’s lives. It is true that many people care little for clothes and scorn the importance that others attach to them; however, this does not mean that the significance that people give to fashion is a waste of time and money.When one considers that areas of the world suffer from poverty, disease and inadequate access to food and clean water, the emphasis attached to fashion by the developed world can seem out of proportion. Many people would contend that the resources put into developing and creating fashion would be more ethically spent on creating some level of equality in terms of the right to live a healthy and happy life. This point is hard to argue with. However, it is also true that people in the developed world cannot be expected to send all their spending money to people in need and that wanting to look good is an unalterable human trait.The fashion industry contributes to the society much like most other industries. It provides jobs and income to millions of people around the world and the money that changes hands generates taxes that contribute to the fabric of society. There is more to fashion than trying to look better than others and excessive luxury. The high level of fashion is indeed a kind of art form and, like other art forms, there will always be people who appreciate it, want to create it and want to spend money on it. It is part of the development of civilisation and this is not likely to change.I therefore feel that, although the gap between the rich and the poor sometimes makes it seem that fashion is a waste of time and money and an unethical use of resources, fashion is an important part of today’s society and economic output. This leads me to believe that trying to strike a balance between selfish greed and a more altruistic way of living should be an individual choice."}

There are people who think that it is important to enrich mind with cultural activities such as reading books and doing word puzzles. On the other hand, there are those who suggest that leisure time is made to relax the mind. I believe that a balance between the two extreme views is the better solution. It is very important to give to coltivate our mind with culture. Reading a book, listen to classical musing, play games in which problem solving tricks should be sold is a funny way to spend your time and at the same time exercise the brain. To spend 15 minutes playing a game in which you have to solve math problems or doing world puzzles can be considered as the mental counterpart of the physical workout. To read a book had always been considered as the best way to learn without studying. Another interesting way in which the brain should be trained is by playing an instruments. To focus on some activities that will encourage the development of your skills and more stimuli on your brain is surely one of the best way to spend a part of your leisure time. On the other hand, it is also important to rest. Also your brain need a break. While it is easy to rest your body by sitting on the sofa it is not equally easy to stop your brain and to give to it a break. Listening to classical music, listening to the sounds of the nature, to have a nice walk, do meditations are some ways in which you can rest your mind. Even if it will be time in which the brain is on pause, some positive effect will be noted. Indeed, after only 30 minutues the brain will be recharged and full of energy. In conclusion, I believe that a balance between intellectual activities and total rest of the brain will be the best solution to give to the mind both stimuli and time to recharge itself. Although the positive effects that will be obtained by spending leisure time in activities that improve the mind, the brain like a computer need sometimes to be put in a standby mode, even if just for a very brief period."}

In my view, this kind of impact could be both crucial and, on a certain level, detrimental.On the one hand, this phenomenon could denote that although we have already had a diverse range of , people are still capable of inventing innovative approaches catering for all kinds of requirements of advertising. It is a symbol that demonstrates the creativity rooted in human beings. Apart from that, it also represents that the speed of spreading information is conspicuously escalating. More purposeful is, therefore, the fact that, besides booming of the advertising, it constitutes a major reason why people could be so prosperous in this digital age.On the other hand, there are various unpleasant consequences as well. Firstly, with the omnipresent , it could potentially cause people to do impulsive shopping. Secondly, the , if regulated in a mismanaged , could make people constantly feel uncomfortable or annoyed. In this sense, instead of being an instrumental tool to promote amenities, advertisements could be considered a hindrance when people are frequently blocked by them. Furthermore, it would cost one precious time to have to sift the helpful ad from a host of others.In conclusion, as far as I am concerned, advertising is a beneficial phenomenon for all with a number of insignificant drawbacks. I believe that in the future we can improve the way advertising is done at present, and embrace the positive influence of advertising even further in the long run."}

What are some simple actions that could help the environment?It is commonly believed that preservation of natural resources is imperative, yet most people seem to exert no effort in doing so. Understanding the causes of this negligent attitude may help with devising some simple measures to safeguard the deteriorating environment.Lack of awareness is probably the foremost reason why the vast majority of individuals appears to be unmindful of the current environmental issues. Normally, people have tendency to downplay abstract problems, or those to happen in the distant future. This is because they are not properly informed of the possible detrimental effects of taking the environment for granted. To illustrate, residents in urban areas often deliberately dump their into the nearby creeks and drainage canals causing them to become clogged. It is only when devastating floods strike, that they come to realize the consequences of their actions.Some basic solutions that could be carried out are extensive awareness through all forms of communication and strict implementation of waste management. In addition to the traditional press, social media is a powerful means of disseminating information regarding the impending disasters and their potential hazards. This is a good way of persuading the public to actively take part in the campaign. Another straightforward solution, and by far the least anyone can do to help save the nature is disposing of garbage thoughtfully. Apart from avoiding throwing trash anywhere, everyone should practice proper segregation of biodegradable, non-biodegradable, and recyclable wastes at all times. These actions, when coordinated by the local governments, can be tremendously successful.In conclusion, while individual awareness is key to maintaining a healthy ecosystem, concerted efforts of governments and are much more effective in achieving such goal."}

Do you agree or disagree?While some believe that rewarding those in managerial positions with higher pay packets is appropriate, not everyone agrees with this view. Personally, I am leaning towards the latter position due to negative impacts caused by significant difference in salaries within a company.For one, executive officers should know that higher than sufficient salaries are not necessary. Indeed, the higher the remuneration they receive, the more likely the company to suffer from devoid of financial capability. Furthermore, they often gain powers that money can’t buy. For instance, they often make important decisions over how to make their company thrive. They are also entitled to allocate company’s budget and designate tasks to other workers. these non-financial entitlements, they should refrain from earning more than reasonable amounts as salaries.Unreasonably high salaries granted to the executives can also afflict other employees. In fact, it is foreseeable that many employees would feel powerless or even when they find out about the huge salary gap between the executive officers’ and theirs. Accordingly, some may leave the company, and others may go on to strike and demand a pay increase. However, those actions . Therefore, unfair salary systems like this would yield unhealthy working environment for both employers and employees.In conclusion, I oppose to those in managerial roles with obscene amounts of compensation because it can cost the company its prosperity and discourage other employees . Thus it is recommended for the company to decide on the salaries of executive officers and general workers by adopting a more motivating salary system."}

People face often face some news reports about a murder case, who were murdered, who is the criminal, and background details. In addition, there are more than 5 channels on TV, these all 5 channels broadcast the same incident at the same time. The Japanese government might take the control of media in order to agitate people to keep their attention on safety. It might be important to some extent, but it is not necessarily a good influence on people's mind if they were required to watch such a fierce, and negative incident every morning.

In addition, almost Japanese crimes tend to be petty crimes, such as thefts, frauds, shop lifting, and so on. In terms of the murder case, Japan is ranked as the 5th safest country among 160 countries in 2017.

On the other hand, they should also report positive and attractive news, such as tourism, especially inbound sales figures has been increasing and contributing to Japanese economic growth, and some Japanese athletes have been successful in MLB(major league baseball), and football. This news must be more fascinating for Japanese people to encourage their own national identity. In conclusion, this is not a black-and-white issue. But it might be more beneficial for people's minds to be positive. If some heavy incidents happened, the Japanese government should restrict TV companies to broadcasting only one channel, or limit the time shorter."}
{"text": "This essay was written on a topic from “Target Band 7” book (page 54, reprinted with permission).You should spend about 40 minutes on this taskObesity was once considered a disease of adults; however, it is becoming increasingly common among children. Why do you think this is happening? What can be done to help children stay healthy?Write at least 250 wordsFor many years obesity was perceived as a condition occurring only in adult life. However, in recent years the number of children suffering from obesity has grown significantly. There are several causes and numerous solutions which can be used to tackle this worrying phenomenon, and this essay will present a couple of them.While some reasons for childhood obesity are genetic, others include poor food choices exacerbated by easy availability of fast food, insufficient physical activity and a history of family members being overweight. Unlike the former, the latter factors can be changed, if the adults in the child’s life gain awareness and are willing to take action.To begin with, health is a complex matter which requires a balanced approach. In other words, there isn’t a single solution to maintain health, on the contrary, it is rather a mixture of multiple factors, such as and regular physical activity. For this reason, increasing the awareness of healthy habits among children is a responsibility of utmost importance. What is more, it can be easily achieved through the education system.On the other hand, children’s education might to stop the situation from worsening. Along with well designed health education schemes, we should also try to stop food companies from overusing sugar in products the young ones. It has been proven that more than 70% of the products available in an average supermarket contain dangerously high levels of white sugar. Sugar rich diet not only causes a significant weight gain, but also contributes to diseases, such as diabetes in young population.To summarize, emphasis put on the awareness of healthy living among children is invaluable.

{"text": "Most people have oponions that the most essential thing for achieving success in any field such as art and sport is natural talent. Other people disagree with this statement and believe that everybody in their early ages can become a professional sportsmen or artist if they are exellently taught. From my point of view, this is an extrimely controversial topic. I honestly believe that children who are interested in the subject they learn and who have natural abilities for some fields can become more successful than those who just encouraged by adults. In this essay, I will discuss both points of view and then give my review to the issue. On the one hand, children who have talents from their births can become advanced in the chosen area because they have natural willingness and abilities to succeed in this field. Those youngsters can spend hours without any interraption in the process of making and creating something. By doing this, they improve their abilities and boost their skills, which become more adcanced in each step. Additionally, they are very involve in their studies without stimulation from others that their achievements are inevitable. For example, my son who is three years old enjoy painting and I always notice some improvements in his paintings, that means that he improve his skills in daily basis. On the other hand, children who do not have talents or nutural abilities for great achievements in any field can be encouraged by adult professionals, who can educate as well as motivate them. For example, when I was a child, I was impressed by music teacher who played the piano in the kindergaten which I visited. After her wonderful performance, I asked my mother to register my for my education in the music school, which was close to our home. So, I was quite motivated to fullfill my dream in getting musical background, that is why I studed hard every day during seven years. I am not only become a musician and got my certificate with exellent marks, but I also won some musical competitions. So, willingness to become successful in chosen field is essential issue. In conclusion, children who have talents and natural abilities for achievements in any field are easely can become successful because they do not need additional motivation from adults, whereas children who found the sphere which they interested in even without talent can improve their skill by allocating more hours and investing more energy for implementing their dream."}
{"text": "Some people believe that the government should take care of old people and provide financial support after they retire. Others say individuals should save during their working years to fund their own retirement. What is your opinion? Give reasons for your answer and include examples from your own experience.It is true that when people advance into their golden years, they require more help and attention. For that reason, a significant number of people hold the opinion that the government should provide financial assistance to the elderly. However, I tend to agree with those who argue that workers should be saving a portion of their income to have a nest egg in their retirement.To begin with, a culture of saving rather than depending on the government may foster the overall economic development of a country. In other words, if people were to accumulate their own savings for their pension age, it would lessen the financial burden on the government. As a result, the government would be able to release more funds to more productive purposes, such as development of infrastructure, industries, hospitals, and so on, which may expedite the overall progression of a country.In addition to economic factors, putting money aside has some personal benefits. Since savings-oriented people are not dependent on the state for their living expenses, this may instill a sense of self-respect and pride in them. On the other hand, those who are reliant on financial assistance very often face the negative societal stigma, as many people consider them to be inferior and unworthy members of society. Hence, to live a life with dignity and pride, taking responsibility for funding one’s own retirement is evidently a better option from individual perspective.In contrast, the provision of monetary outlays for retirees has proven unfeasible in many countries. Since in many nations the number of senior citizens is on the rise, in the long run governments are likely to struggle to sustain the cost of providing for the elderly. The early signs of this have been seen in many countries that were forced to raise the retirement age, including my home country where men can now retire at the age of 67 instead of 65. Therefore, in the foreseeable future, these kinds of support may become completely unsustainable.In conclusion, the provision of state monetary support may undoubtedly lessen the concern of retirees to some extent. However, considering the issue of sustainability of this provision, it is better to opt for individual savings from the very beginning of working life, for the benefit of both individual and national development.This response addresses all parts of the topic, by discussing the merits of funding one’s own retirement versus relying on government pension. The writer’s opinion has been stated as well and is very clear. The neat presentation of ideas has been helped by appropriate paragraphing, and cohesion and coherence are maintained throughout the essay. The author’s vocabulary seems to be rich and there is a variety of sentence structures used in this essay."}

In this essay, I will explore the advantages and disadvantages of this trend.On the one hand, both students and their country can benefit from this trend. First, students can choose more suitable methods for themselves because there are more options. The and teaching methods are quite different . According to foreign experts, Secondly, people can improve their foreign language, they can contact with when they are in a foreign country, and they quickly master the foreign language.

{"text": "In modern times, the younger generation appear to be more powerful and influencial compared to the generations in times past. I believe this is as a result of younger people being more ascertive, stepping up to question and change existing societal norms and archaic cultures. At first, this may negatively affect their relationship with the older generation as a result of how unfamiliar they are to these changes but subsequently, the tension is bound to resolve, when the older generations come to accept these changes. To begin with, it is an open truth that young people these days tend to be very bold and outspoken and unlike their predecessors, are better at questioning norms that do not sit right with them and even going an extra mile to change these norms or cultures. A good example of this is seen in women empowerment and rights activism. In my part of the world, some years back, it was believed that a woman's place is in the kitchen and her sole job was to birth and rear children, therefore, women were not allowed to be educated or have paying jobs. Women in the older generation complied to this because it was the norm, but this is not the case in modern times, because many young women opposed to it and now, homes are even headed by women; the power of activism. Many people in the older generation are not familiar with young people being more outspoken and this is understandable because in their time, they were taught to only follow rules and not to question them. Therefore the fact that young people have become more outspoken and powerful is foreign to them and just like every human nature, whatever is foreign or different is automatically hated. As a result, there is likely going to be a tension between the 2 generations, however, with constant advocation and learning the tension is bound to resolve. For example, going back to women's rights activism, at the start, many older people were not on board as they did not think it was normal, however, there are now a lot of older people who have become activists. In conclusion, I believe that the power and influence the younger generation has is as a result of their ascertiveness and will to effect changes in their societies and even though it may cause a negative relationship with the older generation at first, subsequently, their differences is likely to be ironed out when the older generation learns to accept these changes."}
{"text": "If one wants to work for money, there are really only two options, working for someone else for a salary and being self-employed. Most people are involved with these two options and they both have advantages and disadvantages.Being self-employed means that the worker owns the business that is being done. This might be a small one-person business or a large company with hundreds of employees. The first advantage of this is the capacity to earn more money. If the business does very well, the income can be considerable and the owner of the company will receive the benefits. On the other hand, if business is not good, the owner’s income will be low. Self-employed people also have the benefit to some extent of choosing their working hours and holidays and they have the right to change anything within their business. With this autonomy, however, comes the pressure to succeed and the reliance on one’s employees, if there are any, to do their best to make the business thrive.Salaried workers do not experience the same stress as the self-employed owners of companies. They might have stress in their duties, but the pressure that comes with keeping one’s own business operating successfully in order to support oneself and one’s family is just not felt by an employee. The employee also has a certain knowledge of his or her income, as the salary is usually fixed every month. The self-employed owner’s income often depends on how successful the business is. The employee’s fixed income, however, does not give much scope for earning large amounts more. In addition, an employee does not have the freedoms of the owner or the autonomy, and for many people, having control over their lives is a significant factor to their well-being.It is certain that there are advantages and disadvantages for both being self-employed and salaried. I personally disagree that being salaried is better than being self-employed. I prefer the autonomy that being self-employed brings and, although there is more risk and pressure, this can lead to greater and more fulfilling rewards."}
{"text": "It is often said that all influential TV entertainment programs should be geared towards raising people’s awareness about social issues that matter. While some TV programs could be suitable for this purpose, I disagree with the view that it should be mandatory for all of them, as the decision whether to do so must take into account the nature of the TV content and the channel’s audience.There is a large group of professionals who would benefit from deepening their understanding of what is happening in the world. Stock traders and bankers, for example, must always keep track of numerous business trends on a global scale, and they would appreciate this type of information on their favourite TV shows. Young people are another suitable audience due to the fact that they enjoy learning about popular topics from TV programmes. For instance, SDGs or the Sustainable Development Goals has now become an important topic to learn for children at school. Educational TV would provide a welcome alternative to textbooks, making learning more fun.Despite the potential advantages of incorporating educational content in TV programs, it is important to remember that the purpose of entertainment TV is for people to escape reality, to take a break from their hectic lives. Being reminded about some troubling social issues would not be appreciated by those who just want to unwind after a long day at work. Another consideration is how the content is perceived by the audience, because broadcasting serious topics as part of a comedy show might lead some viewers to believe they are of lesser significance. This would make TV shows of light-hearted nature a poor choice for inclusion of content on pressing social issues.In conclusion, entertainment TV programs can be an effective form of education for some people and a great tool to spread information. However, not all of them should be used for this purpose as there are various ways people appreciate them."}
