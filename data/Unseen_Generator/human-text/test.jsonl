{"text": "Objective: To develop an effective and scalable individual-level patient cost prediction method by automatically learning hidden temporal patterns from multivariate time series data in patient insurance claims using a convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture.   Methods: We used three years of medical and pharmacy claims data from 2013 to 2016 from a healthcare insurer, where data from the first two years were used to build the model to predict costs in the third year. The data consisted of the multivariate time series of cost, visit and medical features that were shaped as images of patients' health status (i.e., matrices with time windows on one dimension and the medical, visit and cost features on the other dimension). Patients' multivariate time series images were given to a CNN method with a proposed architecture. After hyper-parameter tuning, the proposed architecture consisted of three building blocks of convolution and pooling layers with an LReLU activation function and a customized kernel size at each layer for healthcare data. The proposed CNN learned temporal patterns became inputs to a fully connected layer.   Conclusions: Feature learning through the proposed CNN configuration significantly improved individual-level healthcare cost prediction. The proposed CNN was able to outperform temporal pattern detection methods that look for a pre-defined set of pattern shapes, since it is capable of extracting a variable number of patterns with various shapes. Temporal patterns learned from medical, visit and cost data made significant contributions to the prediction performance. Hyper-parameter tuning showed that considering three-month data patterns has the highest prediction accuracy. Our results showed that patients' images extracted from multivariate time series data are different from regular images, and hence require unique designs of CNN architectures."}
{"text": "Incorporating nonlinearity is paramount to predicting the future states of a dynamical system, its response to shocks, and its underlying causal network. However, most existing methods for causality detection and impulse response, such as Vector Autoregression (VAR), assume linearity and are thus unable to capture the complexity. Here, we introduce a vector autoencoder nonlinear autoregression neural network (VANAR) capable of both automatic time series feature extraction for its inputs and functional form estimation. We evaluate VANAR in three ways: first in terms of pure forecast accuracy, second in terms of detecting the correct causality between variables, and lastly in terms of impulse response where we model trajectories given external shocks. These tests were performed on a simulated nonlinear chaotic system and an empirical system using Philippine macroeconomic data. Results show that VANAR significantly outperforms VAR in the forecast and causality tests. VANAR has consistently superior accuracy even over state of the art models such as SARIMA and TBATS. For the impulse response test, both models fail to predict the shocked trajectories of the nonlinear chaotic system. VANAR was robust in its ability to model a wide variety of dynamics, from chaotic, high noise, and low data environments to macroeconomic systems."}
{"text": "Proposed are alternative generator architectures for Boundary Equilibrium Generative Adversarial Networks, motivated by Learning from Simulated and Unsupervised Images through Adversarial Training. It disentangles the need for a noise-based latent space. The generator will operate mainly as a refiner network to gain a photo-realistic presentation of the given synthetic images. It also attempts to resolve the latent space's poorly understood properties by eliminating the need for noise injection and replacing it with an image-based concept. The new flexible and simple generator architecture will also give the power to control the trade-off between restrictive refinement and expressiveness ability. Contrary to other available methods, this architecture will not require a paired or unpaired dataset of real and synthetic images for the training phase. Only a relatively small set of real images would suffice."}
{"text": "Autonomous learning of robotic skills can allow general-purpose robots to learn wide behavioral repertoires without requiring extensive manual engineering. However, robotic skill learning methods typically make one of several trade-offs to enable practical real-world learning, such as requiring manually designed policy or value function representations, initialization from human-provided demonstrations, instrumentation of the training environment, or extremely long training times. In this paper, we propose a new reinforcement learning algorithm for learning manipulation skills that can train general-purpose neural network policies with minimal human engineering, while still allowing for fast, efficient learning in stochastic environments. Our approach builds on the guided policy search (GPS) algorithm, which transforms the reinforcement learning problem into supervised learning from a computational teacher (without human demonstrations). In contrast to prior GPS methods, which require a consistent set of initial states to which the system must be reset after each episode, our approach can handle randomized initial states, allowing it to be used in environments where deterministic resets are impossible. We compare our method to existing policy search techniques in simulation, showing that it can train high-dimensional neural network policies with the same sample efficiency as prior GPS methods, and present real-world results on a PR2 robotic manipulator."}
{"text": "We present a method for hierarchical image segmentation that defines a disaffinity graph on the image, over-segments it into watershed basins, defines a new graph on the basins, and then merges basins with a modified, size-dependent version of single linkage clustering. The quasilinear runtime of the method makes it suitable for segmenting large images. We illustrate the method on the challenging problem of segmenting 3D electron microscopic brain images."}
{"text": "In this paper, we study the problem of outlier arm detection in multi-armed bandit settings, which finds plenty of applications in many high-impact domains such as finance, healthcare, and online advertising. For this problem, a learner aims to identify the arms whose expected rewards deviate significantly from most of the other arms. Different from existing work, we target the generic outlier arms or outlier arm groups whose expected rewards can be larger, smaller, or even in between those of normal arms. To this end, we start by providing a comprehensive definition of such generic outlier arms and outlier arm groups. Then we propose a novel pulling algorithm named GOLD to identify such generic outlier arms. It builds a real-time neighborhood graph based on upper confidence bounds and catches the behavior pattern of outliers from normal arms. We also analyze its performance from various aspects. In the experiments conducted on both synthetic and real-world data sets, the proposed algorithm achieves 98 % accuracy while saving 83 % exploration cost on average compared with state-of-the-art techniques."}
{"text": "We present a novel method to jointly learn a 3D face parametric model and 3D face reconstruction from diverse sources. Previous methods usually learn 3D face modeling from one kind of source, such as scanned data or in-the-wild images. Although 3D scanned data contain accurate geometric information of face shapes, the capture system is expensive and such datasets usually contain a small number of subjects. On the other hand, in-the-wild face images are easily obtained and there are a large number of facial images. However, facial images do not contain explicit geometric information. In this paper, we propose a method to learn a unified face model from diverse sources. Besides scanned face data and face images, we also utilize a large number of RGB-D images captured with an iPhone X to bridge the gap between the two sources. Experimental results demonstrate that with training data from more sources, we can learn a more powerful face model."}
{"text": "Differentiable Neural Architecture Search is one of the most popular Neural Architecture Search (NAS) methods for its search efficiency and simplicity, accomplished by jointly optimizing the model weight and architecture parameters in a weight-sharing supernet via gradient-based algorithms. At the end of the search phase, the operations with the largest architecture parameters will be selected to form the final architecture, with the implicit assumption that the values of architecture parameters reflect the operation strength. While much has been discussed about the supernet's optimization, the architecture selection process has received little attention. We provide empirical and theoretical analysis to show that the magnitude of architecture parameters does not necessarily indicate how much the operation contributes to the supernet's performance. We propose an alternative perturbation-based architecture selection that directly measures each operation's influence on the supernet. We re-evaluate several differentiable NAS methods with the proposed architecture selection and find that it is able to extract significantly improved architectures from the underlying supernets consistently. Furthermore, we find that several failure modes of DARTS can be greatly alleviated with the proposed selection method, indicating that much of the poor generalization observed in DARTS can be attributed to the failure of magnitude-based architecture selection rather than entirely the optimization of its supernet."}
{"text": "Since edge detection is in the forefront of image processing for object detection, it is crucial to have a good understanding of edge detection algorithms. The reason for this is that edges form the outline of an object. An edge is the boundary between an object and the background, and indicates the boundary between overlapping objects. This means that if the edges in an image can be identified accurately, all of the objects can be located and basic properties such as area, perimeter, and shape can be measured. Since computer vision involves the identification and classification of objects in an image, edge detection is an essential tool. We tested two edge detectors that use different methods for detecting edges and compared their results under a variety of situations to determine which detector was preferable under different sets of conditions."}
{"text": "Standard causal discovery methods must fit a new model whenever they encounter samples from a new underlying causal graph. However, these samples often share relevant information - for instance, the dynamics describing the effects of causal relations - which is lost when following this approach. We propose Amortized Causal Discovery, a novel framework that leverages such shared dynamics to learn to infer causal relations from time-series data. This enables us to train a single, amortized model that infers causal relations across samples with different underlying causal graphs, and thus makes use of the information that is shared. We demonstrate experimentally that this approach, implemented as a variational model, leads to significant improvements in causal discovery performance, and show how it can be extended to perform well under hidden confounding."}
{"text": "Neural attention (NA) has become a key component of sequence-to-sequence models that yield state-of-the-art performance in as hard tasks as abstractive document summarization (ADS) and video captioning (VC). NA mechanisms perform inference of context vectors; these constitute weighted sums of deterministic input sequence encodings, adaptively sourced over long temporal horizons. Inspired from recent work in the field of amortized variational inference (AVI), in this work we consider treating the context vectors generated by soft-attention (SA) models as latent variables, with approximate finite mixture model posteriors inferred via AVI. We posit that this formulation may yield stronger generalization capacity, in line with the outcomes of existing applications of AVI to deep networks. To illustrate our method, we implement it and experimentally evaluate it considering challenging ADS, VC, and MT benchmarks. This way, we exhibit its improved effectiveness over state-of-the-art alternatives."}
{"text": "An informative measurement is the most efficient way to gain information about an unknown state. We give a first-principles derivation of a general-purpose dynamic programming algorithm that returns a sequence of informative measurements by sequentially maximizing the entropy of possible measurement outcomes. This algorithm can be used by an autonomous agent or robot to decide where best to measure next, planning a path corresponding to an optimal sequence of informative measurements. This algorithm is applicable to states and controls that are continuous or discrete, and agent dynamics that is either stochastic or deterministic; including Markov decision processes. Recent results from approximate dynamic programming and reinforcement learning, including on-line approximations such as rollout and Monte Carlo tree search, allow an agent or robot to solve the measurement task in real-time. The resulting near-optimal solutions include non-myopic paths and measurement sequences that can generally outperform, sometimes substantially, commonly-used greedy heuristics such as maximizing the entropy of each measurement outcome. This is demonstrated for a global search problem, where on-line planning with an extended local search is found to reduce the number of measurements in the search by half."}
{"text": "The main aim of this work is to develop and implement an automatic anomaly detection algorithm for meteorological time-series.

{"text": "We study the problem of Salient Object Subitizing, i.e. predicting the existence and the number of salient objects in an image using holistic cues. This task is inspired by the ability of people to quickly and accurately identify the number of items within the subitizing range (1-4). To this end, we present a salient object subitizing image dataset of about 14K everyday images which are annotated using an online crowdsourcing marketplace. We show that using an end-to-end trained Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model, we achieve prediction accuracy comparable to human performance in identifying images with zero or one salient object. For images with multiple salient objects, our model also provides significantly better than chance performance without requiring any localization process. Moreover, we propose a method to improve the training of the CNN subitizing model by leveraging synthetic images. In experiments, we demonstrate the accuracy and generalizability of our CNN subitizing model and its applications in salient object detection and image retrieval."}
{"text": "We study a stylized dynamic assortment planning problem during a selling season of finite length T. At each time period, the seller offers an arriving customer an assortment of substitutable products and the customer makes the purchase among offered products according to a discrete choice model. The goal of the seller is to maximize the expected revenue, or equivalently, to minimize the worst-case expected regret. One key challenge is that utilities of products are unknown to the seller and need to be learned. Although the dynamic assortment planning problem has received increasing attention in revenue management, most existing work is based on the multinomial logit choice models (MNL). In this paper, we study the problem of dynamic assortment planning under a more general choice model -- the nested logit model, which models hierarchical choice behavior and is ``the most widely used member of the GEV (generalized extreme value) family''. By leveraging the revenue-ordered structure of the optimal assortment within each nest, we develop a novel upper confidence bound (UCB) policy with an aggregated estimation scheme. Our policy simultaneously learns customers' choice behavior and makes dynamic decisions on assortments based on the current knowledge. It achieves the accumulated regret at the order of \\tilde(), where M is the number of nests and N is the number of products in each nest. We further provide a lower bound result of \\Omega(), which shows the near optimality of the upper bound when T is much larger than M and N. When the number of items per nest N is large, we further provide a discretization heuristic for better performance of our algorithm. Numerical results are presented to demonstrate the empirical performance of our proposed algorithms."}
{"text": "We address the estimation of conditional average treatment effects (CATEs) when treatments are graph-structured (e.g., molecular graphs of drugs). Given a weak condition on the effect, we propose a plug-in estimator that decomposes CATE estimation into separate, simpler optimization problems. Our estimator (a) isolates the causal estimands (reducing regularization bias), and (b) allows one to plug in arbitrary models for learning. In experiments with small-world and molecular graphs, we show that our approach outperforms prior approaches and is robust to varying selection biases. Our implementation is online."}
{"text": "Existing research on action recognition treats activities as monolithic events occurring in videos. Recently, the benefits of formulating actions as a combination of atomic-actions have shown promise in improving action understanding with the emergence of datasets containing such annotations, allowing us to learn representations capturing this information. However, there remains a lack of studies that extend action composition and leverage multiple viewpoints and multiple modalities of data for representation learning. To promote research in this direction, we introduce Home Action Genome (HOMAGE): a multi-view action dataset with multiple modalities and view-points supplemented with hierarchical activity and atomic action labels together with dense scene composition labels. Leveraging rich multi-modal and multi-view settings, we propose Cooperative Compositional Action Understanding (CCAU), a cooperative learning framework for hierarchical action recognition that is aware of compositional action elements. CCAU shows consistent performance improvements across all modalities. Furthermore, we demonstrate the utility of co-learning compositions in few-shot action recognition by achieving 28.6% mAP with just a single sample."}
{"text": "Reconstruction of seismic data with missing traces is a long-standing issue in seismic data processing. In recent years, rank reduction operations are being commonly utilized to overcome this problem, which require the rank of seismic data to be a prior. However, the rank of field data is unknown; usually it requires much time to manually adjust the rank and just obtain an approximated rank. Methods based on deep learning require very large datasets for training; however acquiring large datasets is difficult owing to physical or financial constraints in practice. Therefore, in this work, we developed a novel method based on unsupervised learning using the intrinsic properties of a convolutional neural network known as U-net, without training datasets. Only one undersampled seismic data was needed, and the deep seismic prior of input data could be exploited by the network itself, thus making the reconstruction convenient. Furthermore, this method can handle both irregular and regular seismic data. Synthetic and field data were tested to assess the performance of the proposed algorithm (DSPRecon algorithm); the advantages of using our method were evaluated by comparing it with the singular spectrum analysis (SSA) method for irregular data reconstruction and de-aliased Cadzow method for regular data reconstruction. Experimental results showed that our method provided better reconstruction performance than the SSA or Cadzow methods. The recovered signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) were 32.68 dB and 19.11 dB for the DSPRecon and SSA algorithms, respectively. Those for the DSPRecon and Cadzow methods were 35.91 dB and 15.32 dB, respectively."}
{"text": "Bokeh effect is used in photography to capture images where the closer objects look sharp and every-thing else stays out-of-focus. Bokeh photos are generally captured using Single Lens Reflex cameras using shallow depth-of-field. Most of the modern smartphones can take bokeh images by leveraging dual rear cameras or a good auto-focus hardware. However, for smartphones with single-rear camera without a good auto-focus hardware, we have to rely on software to generate bokeh images. This kind of system is also useful to generate bokeh effect in already captured images. In this paper, an end-to-end deep learning framework is proposed to generate high-quality bokeh effect from images. The original image and different versions of smoothed images are blended to generate Bokeh effect with the help of a monocular depth estimation network. The proposed approach is compared against a saliency detection based baseline and a number of approaches proposed in AIM 2019 Challenge on Bokeh Effect Synthesis. Extensive experiments are shown in order to understand different parts of the proposed algorithm. The network is lightweight and can process an HD image in 0.03 seconds. This approach ranked second in AIM 2019 Bokeh effect challenge-Perceptual Track."}
{"text": "Domain Adaptation (DA) approaches achieved significant improvements in a wide range of machine learning and computer vision tasks (i.e., classification, detection, and segmentation). However, as far as we are aware, there are few methods yet to achieve domain adaptation directly on 3D point cloud data. The unique challenge of point cloud data lies in its abundant spatial geometric information, and the semantics of the whole object is contributed by including regional geometric structures. Specifically, most general-purpose DA methods that struggle for global feature alignment and ignore local geometric information are not suitable for 3D domain alignment. In this paper, we propose a novel 3D Domain Adaptation Network for point cloud data (PointDAN). PointDAN jointly aligns the global and local features in multi-level. For local alignment, we propose Self-Adaptive (SA) node module with an adjusted receptive field to model the discriminative local structures for aligning domains. To represent hierarchically scaled features, node-attention module is further introduced to weight the relationship of SA nodes across objects and domains. For global alignment, an adversarial-training strategy is employed to learn and align global features across domains. Since there is no common evaluation benchmark for 3D point cloud DA scenario, we build a general benchmark (i.e., PointDA-10) extracted from three popular 3D object/scene datasets (i.e., ModelNet, ShapeNet and ScanNet) for cross-domain 3D objects classification fashion. Extensive experiments on PointDA-10 illustrate the superiority of our model over the state-of-the-art general-purpose DA methods."}
{"text": "Visual attention mechanisms are a key component of neural network models for computer vision. By focusing on a discrete set of objects or image regions, these mechanisms identify the most relevant features and use them to build more powerful representations. Recently, continuous-domain alternatives to discrete attention models have been proposed, which exploit the continuity of images. These approaches model attention as simple unimodal densities (e.g. a Gaussian), making them less suitable to deal with images whose region of interest has a complex shape or is composed of multiple non-contiguous patches. In this paper, we introduce a new continuous attention mechanism that produces multimodal densities, in the form of mixtures of Gaussians. We use the EM algorithm to obtain a clustering of relevant regions in the image, and a description length penalty to select the number of components in the mixture. Our densities decompose as a linear combination of unimodal attention mechanisms, enabling closed-form Jacobians for the backpropagation step. Experiments on visual question answering in the VQA-v2 dataset show competitive accuracies and a selection of regions that mimics human attention more closely in VQA-HAT. We present several examples that suggest how multimodal attention maps are naturally more interpretable than their unimodal counterparts, showing the ability of our model to automatically segregate objects from ground in complex scenes."}
{"text": "We propose a novel 3D face recognition algorithm using a deep convolutional neural network (DCNN) and a 3D augmentation technique. The performance of 2D face recognition algorithms has significantly increased by leveraging the representational power of deep neural networks and the use of large-scale labeled training data. As opposed to 2D face recognition, training discriminative deep features for 3D face recognition is very difficult due to the lack of large-scale 3D face datasets. In this paper, we show that transfer learning from a CNN trained on 2D face images can effectively work for 3D face recognition by fine-tuning the CNN with a relatively small number of 3D facial scans. We also propose a 3D face augmentation technique which synthesizes a number of different facial expressions from a single 3D face scan. Our proposed method shows excellent recognition results on Bosphorus, BU-3DFE, and 3D-TEC datasets, without using hand-crafted features. The 3D identification using our deep features also scales well for large databases."}
{"text": "Despite recent advancements in deep learning-based automatic colorization, they are still limited when it comes to few-shot learning. Existing models require a significant amount of training data. To tackle this issue, we present a novel memory-augmented colorization model MemoPainter that can produce high-quality colorization with limited data. In particular, our model is able to capture rare instances and successfully colorize them. We also propose a novel threshold triplet loss that enables unsupervised training of memory networks without the need of class labels. Experiments show that our model has superior quality in both few-shot and one-shot colorization tasks."}
{"text": "While GANs have shown success in realistic image generation, the idea of using GANs for other tasks unrelated to synthesis is underexplored. Do GANs learn meaningful structural parts of objects during their attempt to reproduce those objects? In this work, we test this hypothesis and propose a simple and effective approach based on GANs for semantic part segmentation that requires as few as one label example along with an unlabeled dataset. Our key idea is to leverage a trained GAN to extract pixel-wise representation from the input image and use it as feature vectors for a segmentation network. Our experiments demonstrate that GANs representation is \"readily discriminative\" and produces surprisingly good results that are comparable to those from supervised baselines trained with significantly more labels. We believe this novel repurposing of GANs underlies a new class of unsupervised representation learning that is applicable to many other tasks. More results are available at https://repurposegans.github.io/."}
{"text": "We give a simple, fast algorithm for hyperparameter optimization inspired by techniques from the analysis of Boolean functions. We focus on the high-dimensional regime where the canonical example is training a neural network with a large number of hyperparameters. The algorithm --- an iterative application of compressed sensing techniques for orthogonal polynomials --- requires only uniform sampling of the hyperparameters and is thus easily parallelizable.   Experiments for training deep neural networks on Cifar-10 show that compared to state-of-the-art tools (e.g., Hyperband and Spearmint), our algorithm finds significantly improved solutions, in some cases better than what is attainable by hand-tuning. In terms of overall running time (i.e., time required to sample various settings of hyperparameters plus additional computation time), we are at least an order of magnitude faster than Hyperband and Bayesian Optimization. We also outperform Random Search 8x.   Additionally, our method comes with provable guarantees and yields the first improvements on the sample complexity of learning decision trees in over two decades. In particular, we obtain the first quasi-polynomial time algorithm for learning noisy decision trees with polynomial sample complexity."}
{"text": "We propose a metric, Layer Saturation, defined as the proportion of the number of eigenvalues needed to explain 99% of the variance of the latent representations, for analyzing the learned representations of neural network layers. Saturation is based on spectral analysis and can be computed efficiently, making live analysis of the representations practical during training. We provide an outlook for future applications of this metric by outlining the behaviour of layer saturation in different neural architectures and problems. We further show that saturation is related to the generalization and predictive performance of neural networks."}
{"text": "Situational awareness as a necessity in the connected and autonomous vehicles (CAV) domain is the subject of a significant number of researches in recent years. The driver's safety is directly dependent on the robustness, reliability, and scalability of such systems. Cooperative mechanisms have provided a solution to improve situational awareness by utilizing high speed wireless vehicular networks. These mechanisms mitigate problems such as occlusion and sensor range limitation. However, the network capacity is a factor determining the maximum amount of information being shared among cooperative entities. The notion of feature sharing, proposed in our previous work, aims to address these challenges by maintaining a balance between computation and communication load. In this work, we propose a mechanism to add flexibility in adapting to communication channel capacity and a novel decentralized shared data alignment method to further improve cooperative object detection performance. The performance of the proposed framework is verified through experiments on Volony dataset. The results confirm that our proposed framework outperforms our previous cooperative object detection method (FS-COD) in terms of average precision."}
{"text": "Deep structured output learning shows great promise in tasks like semantic image segmentation. We proffer a new, efficient deep structured model learning scheme, in which we show how deep Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) can be used to estimate the messages in message passing inference for structured prediction with Conditional Random Fields (CRFs). With such CNN message estimators, we obviate the need to learn or evaluate potential functions for message calculation. This confers significant efficiency for learning, since otherwise when performing structured learning for a CRF with CNN potentials it is necessary to undertake expensive inference for every stochastic gradient iteration. The network output dimension for message estimation is the same as the number of classes, in contrast to the network output for general CNN potential functions in CRFs, which is exponential in the order of the potentials. Hence CNN message learning has fewer network parameters and is more scalable for cases that a large number of classes are involved. We apply our method to semantic image segmentation on the PASCAL VOC 2012 dataset. We achieve an intersection-over-union score of 73.4 on its test set, which is the best reported result for methods using the VOC training images alone. This impressive performance demonstrates the effectiveness and usefulness of our CNN message learning method."}
{"text": "We present Earliness-Aware Deep Convolutional Networks (EA-ConvNets), an end-to-end deep learning framework, for early classification of time series data. Unlike most existing methods for early classification of time series data, that are designed to solve this problem under the assumption of the availability of a good set of pre-defined (often hand-crafted) features, our framework can jointly perform feature learning (by learning a deep hierarchy of  capturing the salient characteristics in each time series), along with a dynamic truncation model to help our deep feature learning architecture focus on the early parts of each time series. Consequently, our framework is able to make highly reliable early predictions, outperforming various state-of-the-art methods for early time series classification, while also being competitive when compared to the state-of-the-art time series classification algorithms that work with  time series data. To the best of our knowledge, the proposed framework is the first to perform data-driven (deep) feature learning in the context of early classification of time series data. We perform a comprehensive set of experiments, on several benchmark data sets, which demonstrate that our method yields significantly better predictions than various state-of-the-art methods designed for early time series classification. In addition to obtaining high accuracies, our experiments also show that the learned deep shapelets based features are also highly interpretable and can help gain better understanding of the underlying characteristics of time series data."}
{"text": "Instance-based interpretation methods have been widely studied for supervised learning methods as they help explain how black box neural networks predict. However, instance-based interpretations remain ill-understood in the context of unsupervised learning. In this paper, we investigate influence functions [20], a popular instance-based interpretation method, for a class of deep generative models called variational auto-encoders (VAE). We formally frame the counter-factual question answered by influence functions in this setting, and through theoretical analysis, examine what they reveal about the impact of training samples on classical unsupervised learning methods. We then introduce VAE-TracIn, a computationally efficient and theoretically sound solution based on Pruthi et al. [28], for VAEs. Finally, we evaluate VAE-TracIn on several real world datasets with extensive quantitative and qualitative analysis."}
{"text": "Deep generative models have been enjoying success in modeling continuous data. However it remains challenging to capture the representations for discrete structures with formal grammars and semantics, e.g., computer programs and molecular structures. How to generate both syntactically and semantically correct data still remains largely an open problem. Inspired by the theory of compiler where the syntax and semantics check is done via syntax-directed translation (SDT), we propose a novel syntax-directed variational autoencoder (SD-VAE) by introducing stochastic lazy attributes. This approach converts the offline SDT check into on-the-fly generated guidance for constraining the decoder. Comparing to the state-of-the-art methods, our approach enforces constraints on the output space so that the output will be not only syntactically valid, but also semantically reasonable. We evaluate the proposed model with applications in programming language and molecules, including reconstruction and program/molecule optimization. The results demonstrate the effectiveness in incorporating syntactic and semantic constraints in discrete generative models, which is significantly better than current state-of-the-art approaches."}
{"text": "This paper re-examines a continuous optimization framework dubbed NOTEARS for learning Bayesian networks. We first generalize existing algebraic characterizations of acyclicity to a class of matrix polynomials. Next, focusing on a one-parameter-per-edge setting, it is shown that the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) optimality conditions for the NOTEARS formulation cannot be satisfied except in a trivial case, which explains a behavior of the associated algorithm. We then derive the KKT conditions for an equivalent reformulation, show that they are indeed necessary, and relate them to explicit constraints that certain edges be absent from the graph. If the score function is convex, these KKT conditions are also sufficient for local minimality despite the non-convexity of the constraint. Informed by the KKT conditions, a local search post-processing algorithm is proposed and shown to substantially and universally improve the structural Hamming distance of all tested algorithms, typically by a factor of 2 or more. Some combinations with local search are both more accurate and more efficient than the original NOTEARS."}
{"text": "Braille has empowered visually challenged community to read and write. But at the same time, it has created a gap due to widespread inability of non-Braille users to understand Braille scripts. This gap has fuelled researchers to propose Optical Braille Recognition techniques to convert Braille documents to natural language. The main motivation of this work is to cement the communication gap at academic institutions by translating personal documents of blind students. This has been accomplished by proposing an economical and effective technique which digitizes Braille documents using a smartphone camera. For any given Braille image, a dot detection mechanism based on Hough transform is proposed which is invariant to skewness, noise and other deterrents. The detected dots are then clustered into Braille cells using distance-based clustering algorithm. In succession, the standard physical parameters of each Braille cells are estimated for feature extraction and classification as natural language characters. The comprehensive evaluation of this technique on the proposed dataset of 54 Braille scripts has yielded into accuracy of 98.71%."}
{"text": "For relocalization in large-scale point clouds, we propose the first approach that unifies global place recognition and local 6DoF pose refinement. To this end, we design a Siamese network that jointly learns 3D local feature detection and description directly from raw 3D points. It integrates FlexConv and Squeeze-and-Excitation (SE) to assure that the learned local descriptor captures multi-level geometric information and channel-wise relations. For detecting 3D keypoints we predict the discriminativeness of the local descriptors in an unsupervised manner. We generate the global descriptor by directly aggregating the learned local descriptors with an effective attention mechanism. In this way, local and global 3D descriptors are inferred in one single forward pass. Experiments on various benchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves competitive results for both global point cloud retrieval and local point cloud registration in comparison to state-of-the-art approaches. To validate the generalizability and robustness of our 3D keypoints, we demonstrate that our method also performs favorably without fine-tuning on the registration of point clouds that were generated by a visual SLAM system.

{"text": "This paper describes Georeference Contrastive Learning of visual Representation (GeoCLR) for efficient training of deep-learning Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). The method leverages georeference information by generating a similar image pair using images taken of nearby locations, and contrasting these with an image pair that is far apart. The underlying assumption is that images gathered within a close distance are more likely to have similar visual appearance, where this can be reasonably satisfied in seafloor robotic imaging applications where image footprints are limited to edge lengths of a few metres and are taken so that they overlap along a vehicle's trajectory, whereas seafloor substrates and habitats have patch sizes that are far larger. A key advantage of this method is that it is self-supervised and does not require any human input for CNN training. The method is computationally efficient, where results can be generated between dives during multi-day AUV missions using computational resources that would be accessible during most oceanic field trials. We apply GeoCLR to habitat classification on a dataset that consists of ~86k images gathered using an Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV). We demonstrate how the latent representations generated by GeoCLR can be used to efficiently guide human annotation efforts, where the semi-supervised framework improves classification accuracy by an average of 11.8 % compared to state-of-the-art transfer learning using the same CNN and equivalent number of human annotations for training."}
{"text": "Video understanding calls for a model to learn the characteristic interplay between static scene content and its dynamics: Given an image, the model must be able to predict a future progression of the portrayed scene and, conversely, a video should be explained in terms of its static image content and all the remaining characteristics not present in the initial frame. This naturally suggests a bijective mapping between the video domain and the static content as well as residual information. In contrast to common stochastic image-to-video synthesis, such a model does not merely generate arbitrary videos progressing the initial image. Given this image, it rather provides a one-to-one mapping between the residual vectors and the video with stochastic outcomes when sampling. The approach is naturally implemented using a conditional invertible neural network (cINN) that can explain videos by independently modelling static and other video characteristics, thus laying the basis for controlled video synthesis. Experiments on four diverse video datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in terms of both the quality and diversity of the synthesized results.

{"text": "The recent explosive interest on transformers has suggested their potential to become powerful ``universal\" models for computer vision tasks, such as classification, detection, and segmentation. While those attempts mainly study the discriminative models, we explore transformers on some more notoriously difficult vision tasks, e.g., generative adversarial networks (GANs). Our goal is to conduct the first pilot study in building a GAN completely free of convolutions, using only pure transformer-based architectures. Our vanilla GAN architecture, dubbed TransGAN, consists of a memory-friendly transformer-based generator that progressively increases feature resolution, and correspondingly a multi-scale discriminator to capture simultaneously semantic contexts and low-level textures. On top of them, we introduce the new module of grid self-attention for alleviating the memory bottleneck further, in order to scale up TransGAN to high-resolution generation. We also develop a unique training recipe including a series of techniques that can mitigate the training instability issues of TransGAN, such as data augmentation, modified normalization, and relative position encoding. Our best architecture achieves highly competitive performance compared to current state-of-the-art GANs using convolutional backbones. Specifically, TransGAN sets new state-of-the-art inception score of 10.43 and FID of 18.28 on STL-10, outperforming StyleGAN-V2. When it comes to higher-resolution (e.g. 256 x 256) generation tasks, such as on CelebA-HQ and LSUN-Church, TransGAN continues to produce diverse visual examples with high fidelity and impressive texture details. In addition, we dive deep into the transformer-based generation models to understand how their behaviors differ from convolutional ones, by visualizing training dynamics. The code is available at https://github.com/VITA-Group/TransGAN."}
{"text": "In this paper, we introduce SalsaNext for the uncertainty-aware semantic segmentation of a full 3D LiDAR point cloud in real-time. SalsaNext is the next version of SalsaNet [1] which has an encoder-decoder architecture where the encoder unit has a set of ResNet blocks and the decoder part combines upsampled features from the residual blocks. In contrast to SalsaNet, we introduce a new context module, replace the ResNet encoder blocks with a new residual dilated convolution stack with gradually increasing receptive fields and add the pixel-shuffle layer in the decoder. Additionally, we switch from stride convolution to average pooling and also apply central dropout treatment. To directly optimize the Jaccard index, we further combine the weighted cross-entropy loss with Lovasz-Softmax loss [2]. We finally inject a Bayesian treatment to compute the epistemic and aleatoric uncertainties for each point in the cloud. We provide a thorough quantitative evaluation on the Semantic-KITTI dataset [3], which demonstrates that the proposed SalsaNext outperforms other state-of-the-art semantic segmentation networks and ranks first on the Semantic-KITTI leaderboard. We also release our source code https://github.com/TiagoCortinhal/SalsaNext."}
{"text": "Glycemic control is essential for critical care. However, it is a challenging task because there has been no study on personalized optimal strategies for glycemic control. This work aims to learn personalized optimal glycemic trajectories for severely ill septic patients by learning data-driven policies to identify optimal targeted blood glucose levels as a reference for clinicians. We encoded patient states using a sparse autoencoder and adopted a reinforcement learning paradigm using policy iteration to learn the optimal policy from data. We also estimated the expected return following the policy learned from the recorded glycemic trajectories, which yielded a function indicating the relationship between real blood glucose values and 90-day mortality rates. This suggests that the learned optimal policy could reduce the patients' estimated 90-day mortality rate by 6.3%, from 31% to 24.7%. The result demonstrates that reinforcement learning with appropriate patient state encoding can potentially provide optimal glycemic trajectories and allow clinicians to design a personalized strategy for glycemic control in septic patients."}
{"text": "In reinforcement learning, the state of the real world is often represented by feature vectors. However, not all of the features may be pertinent for solving the current task. We propose Feature Selection Explore and Exploit (FS-EE), an algorithm that automatically selects the necessary features while learning a Factored Markov Decision Process, and prove that under mild assumptions, its sample complexity scales with the in-degree of the dynamics of just the necessary features, rather than the in-degree of all features. This can result in a much better sample complexity when the in-degree of the necessary features is smaller than the in-degree of all features."}
{"text": "Vision-based depth estimation is a key feature in autonomous systems, which often relies on a single camera or several independent ones. In such a monocular setup, dense depth is obtained with either additional input from one or several expensive LiDARs, e.g., with 64 beams, or camera-only methods, which suffer from scale-ambiguity and infinite-depth problems. In this paper, we propose a new alternative of densely estimating metric depth by combining a monocular camera with a light-weight LiDAR, e.g., with 4 beams, typical of today's automotive-grade mass-produced laser scanners. Inspired by recent self-supervised methods, we introduce a novel framework, called LiDARTouch, to estimate dense depth maps from monocular images with the help of ``touches'' of LiDAR, i.e., without the need for dense ground-truth depth. In our setup, the minimal LiDAR input contributes on three different levels: as an additional model's input, in a self-supervised LiDAR reconstruction objective function, and to estimate changes of pose (a key component of self-supervised depth estimation architectures). Our LiDARTouch framework achieves new state of the art in self-supervised depth estimation on the KITTI dataset, thus supporting our choices of integrating the very sparse LiDAR signal with other visual features. Moreover, we show that the use of a few-beam LiDAR alleviates scale ambiguity and infinite-depth issues that camera-only methods suffer from. We also demonstrate that methods from the fully-supervised depth-completion literature can be adapted to a self-supervised regime with a minimal LiDAR signal."}
{"text": "We propose a reinforcement learning solution to the , a scenario in which a soccer agent has to go from the beginning to the end of a region keeping possession of the ball, as an adversary attempts to gain possession. While the adversary uses a stationary policy, the dribbler learns the best action to take at each decision point. After defining meaningful variables to represent the state space, and high-level macro-actions to incorporate domain knowledge, we describe our application of the reinforcement learning algorithm  with CMAC for function approximation. Our experiments show that, after the training period, the dribbler is able to accomplish its task against a strong adversary around 58% of the time."}
{"text": "Remote photoplethysmography (rPPG), which aims at measuring heart activities without any contact, has great potential in many applications (e.g., remote healthcare). Existing end-to-end rPPG and heart rate (HR) measurement methods from facial videos are vulnerable to the less-constrained scenarios (e.g., with head movement and bad illumination). In this letter, we explore the reason why existing end-to-end networks perform poorly in challenging conditions and establish a strong end-to-end baseline (AutoHR) for remote HR measurement with neural architecture search (NAS). The proposed method includes three parts: 1) a powerful searched backbone with novel Temporal Difference Convolution (TDC), intending to capture intrinsic rPPG-aware clues between frames; 2) a hybrid loss function considering constraints from both time and frequency domains; and 3) spatio-temporal data augmentation strategies for better representation learning. Comprehensive experiments are performed on three benchmark datasets to show our superior performance on both intra- and cross-dataset testing."}
{"text": "The reinforcement learning (RL) research area is very active, with an important number of new contributions; especially considering the emergent field of deep RL (DRL). However a number of scientific and technical challenges still need to be addressed, amongst which we can mention the ability to abstract actions or the difficulty to explore the environment which can be addressed by intrinsic motivation (IM). In this article, we provide a survey on the role of intrinsic motivation in DRL. We categorize the different kinds of intrinsic motivations and detail for each category, its advantages and limitations with respect to the mentioned challenges. Additionnally, we conduct an in-depth investigation of substantial current research questions, that are currently under study or not addressed at all in the considered research area of DRL. We choose to survey these research works, from the perspective of learning how to achieve tasks. We suggest then, that solving current challenges could lead to a larger developmental architecture which may tackle most of the tasks. We describe this developmental architecture on the basis of several building blocks composed of a RL algorithm and an IM module compressing information."}
{"text": "Video super-resolution (VSR) aims to restore a photo-realistic high-resolution (HR) video frame from both its corresponding low-resolution (LR) frame (reference frame) and multiple neighboring frames (supporting frames). Due to varying motion of cameras or objects, the reference frame and each support frame are not aligned. Therefore, temporal alignment is a challenging yet important problem for VSR. Previous VSR methods usually utilize optical flow between the reference frame and each supporting frame to wrap the supporting frame for temporal alignment. Therefore, the performance of these image-level wrapping-based models will highly depend on the prediction accuracy of optical flow, and inaccurate optical flow will lead to artifacts in the wrapped supporting frames, which also will be propagated into the reconstructed HR video frame. To overcome the limitation, in this paper, we propose a temporal deformable alignment network (TDAN) to adaptively align the reference frame and each supporting frame at the feature level without computing optical flow. The TDAN uses features from both the reference frame and each supporting frame to dynamically predict offsets of sampling convolution kernels. By using the corresponding kernels, TDAN transforms supporting frames to align with the reference frame. To predict the HR video frame, a reconstruction network taking aligned frames and the reference frame is utilized. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed TDAN-based VSR model."}
{"text": "Recent deep learning approaches for representation learning on graphs follow a neighborhood aggregation procedure. We analyze some important properties of these models, and propose a strategy to overcome those. In particular, the range of \"neighboring\" nodes that a node's representation draws from strongly depends on the graph structure, analogous to the spread of a random walk. To adapt to local neighborhood properties and tasks, we explore an architecture -- jumping knowledge (JK) networks -- that flexibly leverages, for each node, different neighborhood ranges to enable better structure-aware representation. In a number of experiments on social, bioinformatics and citation networks, we demonstrate that our model achieves state-of-the-art performance. Furthermore, combining the JK framework with models like Graph Convolutional Networks, GraphSAGE and Graph Attention Networks consistently improves those models' performance."}
{"text": "This paper is a brief report to our submission to the Recognizing Families In the Wild Data Challenge (4th Edition), in conjunction with FG 2020 Forum. Automatic kinship recognition has attracted many researchers' attention for its full application, but it is still a very challenging task because of the limited information that can be used to determine whether a pair of faces are blood relatives or not. In this paper, we studied previous methods and proposed our method. We try many methods, like deep metric learning-based, to extract deep embedding feature for every image, then determine if they are blood relatives by Euclidean distance or method based on classes. Finally, we find some tricks like sampling more negative samples and high resolution that can help get better performance. Moreover, we proposed a symmetric network with a binary classification based method to get our best score in all tasks."}
{"text": "We propose a new perspective on video understanding by casting the video recognition problem as an image recognition task. We show that an image classifier alone can suffice for video understanding without temporal modeling. Our approach is simple and universal. It composes input frames into a super image to train an image classifier to fulfill the task of action recognition, in exactly the same way as classifying an image. We prove the viability of such an idea by demonstrating strong and promising performance on four public datasets including Kinetics400, Something-to-something (V2), MiT and Jester, using a recently developed vision transformer. We also experiment with the prevalent ResNet image classifiers in computer vision to further validate our idea. The results on Kinetics400 are comparable to some of the best-performed CNN approaches based on spatio-temporal modeling. our code and models will be made available at https://github.com/IBM/sifar-pytorch."}
{"text": "It has been experimentally observed that the efficiency of distributed training with stochastic gradient (SGD) depends decisively on the batch size and -- in asynchronous implementations -- on the gradient staleness. Especially, it has been observed that the speedup saturates beyond a certain batch size and/or when the delays grow too large. We identify a data-dependent parameter that explains the speedup saturation in both these settings. Our comprehensive theoretical analysis, for strongly convex, convex and non-convex settings, unifies and generalized prior work directions that often focused on only one of these two aspects. In particular, our approach allows us to derive improved speedup results under frequently considered sparsity assumptions. Our insights give rise to theoretically based guidelines on how the learning rates can be adjusted in practice. We show that our results are tight and illustrate key findings in numerical experiments."}
{"text": "As camera networks have become more ubiquitous over the past decade, the research interest in video management has shifted to analytics on multi-camera networks. This includes performing tasks such as object detection, attribute identification, and vehicle/person tracking across different cameras without overlap. Current frameworks for management are designed for multi-camera networks in a closed dataset environment where there is limited variability in cameras and characteristics of the surveillance environment are well known. Furthermore, current frameworks are designed for offline analytics with guidance from human operators for forensic applications. This paper presents a teamed classifier framework for video analytics in heterogeneous many-camera networks with adversarial conditions such as multi-scale, multi-resolution cameras capturing the environment with varying occlusion, blur, and orientations. We describe an implementation for vehicle tracking and vehicle re-identification (re-id), where we implement a zero-shot learning (ZSL) system that performs automated tracking of all vehicles all the time. Our evaluations on VeRi-776 and Cars196 show the teamed classifier framework is robust to adversarial conditions, extensible to changing video characteristics such as new vehicle types/brands and new cameras, and offers real-time performance compared to current offline video analytics approaches."}
{"text": "Most Siamese network-based trackers perform the tracking process without model update, and cannot learn targetspecific variation adaptively. Moreover, Siamese-based trackers infer the new state of tracked objects by generating axis-aligned bounding boxes, which contain extra background noise, and are unable to accurately estimate the rotation and scale transformation of moving objects, thus potentially reducing tracking performance. In this paper, we propose a novel Rotation-Scale Invariant Network (RSINet) to address the above problem. Our RSINet tracker consists of a target-distractor discrimination branch and a rotation-scale estimation branch, the rotation and scale knowledge can be explicitly learned by a multi-task learning method in an end-to-end manner. In addtion, the tracking model is adaptively optimized and updated under spatio-temporal energy control, which ensures model stability and reliability, as well as high tracking efficiency. Comprehensive experiments on OTB-100, VOT2018, and LaSOT benchmarks demonstrate that our proposed RSINet tracker yields new state-of-the-art performance compared with recent trackers, while running at real-time speed about 45 FPS."}
{"text": "Slope difference distribution (SDD) is computed for the one-dimensional curve. It is not only robust to calculate the partitioning point to separate the curve logically, but also robust to calculate the clustering center of each part of the separated curve. SDD has been proposed for image segmentation and it outperforms all existing image segmentation methods. For verification purpose, we have made the Matlab codes of comparing SDD method with existing image segmentation methods freely available at Matlab Central. The contour of the object is similar to the histogram of the image. Thus, feature detection by SDD from the contour of the object is also feasible. In this letter, SDD features are defined and they form the sparse representation of the object contour. The reference model of each object is built based on the SDD features and then model matching is used for on line object recognition. The experimental results are very encouraging. For the gesture recognition, SDD achieved 100% accuracy for two public datasets: the NUS dataset and the near-infrared dataset. For the object recognition, SDD achieved 100% accuracy for the Kimia 99 dataset."}
{"text": "Building machine learning models using EEG recorded outside of the laboratory setting requires methods robust to noisy data and randomly missing channels. This need is particularly great when working with sparse EEG montages (1-6 channels), often encountered in consumer-grade or mobile EEG devices. Neither classical machine learning models nor deep neural networks trained end-to-end on EEG are typically designed or tested for robustness to corruption, and especially to randomly missing channels. While some studies have proposed strategies for using data with missing channels, these approaches are not practical when sparse montages are used and computing power is limited (e.g., wearables, cell phones). To tackle this problem, we propose dynamic spatial filtering (DSF), a multi-head attention module that can be plugged in before the first layer of a neural network to handle missing EEG channels by learning to focus on good channels and to ignore bad ones. We tested DSF on public EEG data encompassing ~4,000 recordings with simulated channel corruption and on a private dataset of ~100 at-home recordings of mobile EEG with natural corruption. Our proposed approach achieves the same performance as baseline models when no noise is applied, but outperforms baselines by as much as 29.4% accuracy when significant channel corruption is present. Moreover, DSF outputs are interpretable, making it possible to monitor channel importance in real-time. This approach has the potential to enable the analysis of EEG in challenging settings where channel corruption hampers the reading of brain signals."}
{"text": "Purpose: Image classification is perhaps the most fundamental task in imaging AI. However, labeling images is time-consuming and tedious. We have recently demonstrated that reinforcement learning (RL) can classify 2D slices of MRI brain images with high accuracy. Here we make two important steps toward speeding image classification: Firstly, we automatically extract class labels from the clinical reports. Secondly, we extend our prior 2D classification work to fully 3D image volumes from our institution. Hence, we proceed as follows: in Part 1, we extract labels from reports automatically using the SBERT natural language processing approach. Then, in Part 2, we use these labels with RL to train a classification Deep-Q Network (DQN) for 3D image volumes.   Methods: For Part 1, we trained SBERT with 90 radiology report impressions. We then used the trained SBERT to predict class labels for use in Part 2. In Part 2, we applied multi-step image classification to allow for combined Deep-Q learning using 3D convolutions and TD(0) Q learning. We trained on a set of 90 images. We tested on a separate set of 61 images, again using the classes predicted from patient reports by the trained SBERT in Part 1. For comparison, we also trained and tested a supervised deep learning classification network on the same set of training and testing images using the same labels.   Results: Part 1: Upon training with the corpus of radiology reports, the SBERT model had 100% accuracy for both normal and metastasis-containing scans. Part 2: Then, using these labels, whereas the supervised approach quickly overfit the training data and as expected performed poorly on the testing set (66% accuracy, just over random guessing), the reinforcement learning approach achieved an accuracy of 92%. The results were found to be statistically significant, with a p-value of 3.1 x 10^-5."}
{"text": "Various fonts give us various impressions, which are often represented by words. This paper proposes Impressions2Font (Imp2Font) that generates font images with specific impressions. Imp2Font is an extended version of conditional generative adversarial networks (GANs). More precisely, Imp2Font accepts an arbitrary number of impression words as the condition to generate the font images. These impression words are converted into a soft-constraint vector by an impression embedding module built on a word embedding technique. Qualitative and quantitative evaluations prove that Imp2Font generates font images with higher quality than comparative methods by providing multiple impression words or even unlearned words."}
{"text": "Monocular depth estimation and semantic segmentation are two fundamental goals of scene understanding. Due to the advantages of task interaction, many works study the joint task learning algorithm. However, most existing methods fail to fully leverage the semantic labels, ignoring the provided context structures and only using them to supervise the prediction of segmentation split, which limit the performance of both tasks. In this paper, we propose a network injected with contextual information (CI-Net) to solve the problem. Specifically, we introduce self-attention block in the encoder to generate attention map. With supervision from the ideal attention map created by semantic label, the network is embedded with contextual information so that it could understand scene better and utilize correlated features to make accurate prediction. Besides, a feature sharing module is constructed to make the task-specific features deeply fused and a consistency loss is devised to make the features mutually guided. We evaluate the proposed CI-Net on the NYU-Depth-v2 and SUN-RGBD datasets. The experimental results validate that our proposed CI-Net could effectively improve the accuracy of semantic segmentation and depth estimation."}
{"text": "Image colorization achieves more and more realistic results with the increasing computation power of recent deep learning techniques. It becomes more difficult to identify the fake colorized images by human eyes. In this work, we propose a novel forensic method to distinguish between natural images (NIs) and colorized images (CIs) based on convolutional neural network (CNN). Our method is able to achieve high classification accuracy and cope with the challenging scenario of blind detection, i.e., no training sample is available from \"unknown\" colorization algorithm that we may encounter during the testing phase. This blind detection performance can be regarded as a generalization performance. First, we design and implement a base network, which can attain better performance in terms of classification accuracy and generalization (in most cases) compared with state-of-the-art methods. Furthermore, we design a new branch, which analyzes smaller regions of extracted features, and insert it into the above base network. Consequently, our network can not only improve the classification accuracy, but also enhance the generalization in the vast majority of cases. To further improve the performance of blind detection, we propose to automatically construct negative samples through linear interpolation of paired natural and colorized images. Then, we progressively insert these negative samples into the original training dataset and continue to train the network. Experimental results demonstrate that our method can achieve stable and high generalization performance when tested against different state-of-the-art colorization algorithms."}

However, TEOM-based sensor has higher probability of malfunctioning than BAM-based sensor. In this paper, we call the overall malfunction as an anomaly, and we aim to detect anomalies for the maintenance of PM measuring sensors.

We experimentally compare the several anomaly detection architectures to certify ours performing better."}
{"text": "We propose methods to train convolutional neural networks (CNNs) with both binarized weights and activations, leading to quantized models that are specifically friendly to mobile devices with limited power capacity and computation resources. Previous works on quantizing CNNs often seek to approximate the floating-point information using a set of discrete values, which we call value approximation, typically assuming the same architecture as the full-precision networks. Here we take a novel \"structure approximation\" view of quantization -- it is very likely that different architectures designed for low-bit networks may be better for achieving good performance. In particular, we propose a \"network decomposition\" strategy, termed Group-Net, in which we divide the network into groups. Thus, each full-precision group can be effectively reconstructed by aggregating a set of homogeneous binary branches. In addition, we learn effective connections among groups to improve the representation capability. Moreover, the proposed Group-Net shows strong generalization to other tasks. For instance, we extend Group-Net for accurate semantic segmentation by embedding rich context into the binary structure. Furthermore, for the first time, we apply binary neural networks to object detection. Experiments on both classification, semantic segmentation and object detection tasks demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed methods over various quantized networks in the literature. Our methods outperform the previous best binary neural networks in terms of accuracy and computation efficiency."}
{"text": "Dense video captioning aims to localize and describe important events in untrimmed videos. Existing methods mainly tackle this task by exploiting only visual features, while completely neglecting the audio track. Only a few prior works have utilized both modalities, yet they show poor results or demonstrate the importance on a dataset with a specific domain. In this paper, we introduce Bi-modal Transformer which generalizes the Transformer architecture for a bi-modal input. We show the effectiveness of the proposed model with audio and visual modalities on the dense video captioning task, yet the module is capable of digesting any two modalities in a sequence-to-sequence task. We also show that the pre-trained bi-modal encoder as a part of the bi-modal transformer can be used as a feature extractor for a simple proposal generation module. The performance is demonstrated on a challenging ActivityNet Captions dataset where our model achieves outstanding performance. The code is available: v-iashin.github.io/bmt"}
{"text": "With the advancements made in deep learning, computer vision problems like object detection and segmentation have seen a great improvement in performance. However, in many real-world applications such as autonomous driving vehicles, the risk associated with incorrect predictions of objects is very high. Standard deep learning models for object detection such as YOLO models are often overconfident in their predictions and do not take into account the uncertainty in predictions on out-of-distribution data. In this work, we propose an efficient and effective approach to model uncertainty in object detection and segmentation tasks using Monte-Carlo DropBlock (MC-DropBlock) based inference. The proposed approach applies drop-block during training time and test time on the convolutional layer of the deep learning models such as YOLO. We show that this leads to a Bayesian convolutional neural network capable of capturing the epistemic uncertainty in the model. Additionally, we capture the aleatoric uncertainty using a Gaussian likelihood. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach on modeling uncertainty in object detection and segmentation tasks using out-of-distribution experiments. Experimental results show that MC-DropBlock improves the generalization, calibration, and uncertainty modeling capabilities of YOLO models in object detection and segmentation."}
{"text": "In recent years, deep neural networks (DNNs) achieved unprecedented performance in many low-level vision tasks. However, state-of-the-art results are typically achieved by very deep networks, which can reach tens of layers with tens of millions of parameters. To make DNNs implementable on platforms with limited resources, it is necessary to weaken the tradeoff between performance and efficiency. In this paper, we propose a new activation unit, which is particularly suitable for image restoration problems. In contrast to the widespread per-pixel activation units, like ReLUs and sigmoids, our unit implements a learnable nonlinear function with spatial connections. This enables the net to capture much more complex features, thus requiring a significantly smaller number of layers in order to reach the same performance. We illustrate the effectiveness of our units through experiments with state-of-the-art nets for denoising, de-raining, and super resolution, which are already considered to be very small. With our approach, we are able to further reduce these models by nearly 50% without incurring any degradation in performance."}
{"text": "In self-supervised learning, one trains a model to solve a so-called pretext task on a dataset without the need for human annotation. The main objective, however, is to transfer this model to a target domain and task. Currently, the most effective transfer strategy is fine-tuning, which restricts one to use the same model or parts thereof for both pretext and target tasks. In this paper, we present a novel framework for self-supervised learning that overcomes limitations in designing and comparing different tasks, models, and data domains. In particular, our framework decouples the structure of the self-supervised model from the final task-specific fine-tuned model. This allows us to: 1) quantitatively assess previously incompatible models including handcrafted features; 2) show that deeper neural network models can learn better representations from the same pretext task; 3) transfer knowledge learned with a deep model to a shallower one and thus boost its learning. We use this framework to design a novel self-supervised task, which achieves state-of-the-art performance on the common benchmarks in PASCAL VOC 2007, ILSVRC12 and Places by a significant margin. Our learned features shrink the mAP gap between models trained via self-supervised learning and supervised learning from 5.9% to 2.6% in object detection on PASCAL VOC 2007."}
{"text": "Deep neural network architectures have traditionally been designed and explored with human expertise in a long-lasting trial-and-error process. This process requires huge amount of time, expertise, and resources. To address this tedious problem, we propose a novel algorithm to optimally find hyperparameters of a deep network architecture automatically. We specifically focus on designing neural architectures for medical image segmentation task. Our proposed method is based on a policy gradient reinforcement learning for which the reward function is assigned a segmentation evaluation utility (i.e., dice index). We show the efficacy of the proposed method with its low computational cost in comparison with the state-of-the-art medical image segmentation networks. We also present a new architecture design, a densely connected encoder-decoder CNN, as a strong baseline architecture to apply the proposed hyperparameter search algorithm. We apply the proposed algorithm to each layer of the baseline architectures. As an application, we train the proposed system on cine cardiac MR images from Automated Cardiac Diagnosis Challenge (ACDC) MICCAI 2017. Starting from a baseline segmentation architecture, the resulting network architecture obtains the state-of-the-art results in accuracy without performing any trial-and-error based architecture design approaches or close supervision of the hyperparameters changes."}
{"text": "Graph neural networks (GNNs) have been investigated for potential applicability in multiple fields that employ graph data. However, there are no standard training settings to ensure fair comparisons among new methods, including different model architectures and data augmentation techniques. We introduce a standard, reproducible benchmark to which the same training settings can be applied for node classification. For this benchmark, we constructed 9 datasets, including both small- and medium-scale datasets from different fields, and 7 different models. We design a k-fold model assessment strategy for small datasets and a standard set of model training procedures for all datasets, enabling a standard experimental pipeline for GNNs to help ensure fair model architecture comparisons. We use node2vec and Laplacian eigenvectors to perform data augmentation to investigate how input features affect the performance of the models. We find topological information is important for node classification tasks. Increasing the number of model layers does not improve the performance except on the PATTERN and CLUSTER datasets, in which the graphs are not connected. Data augmentation is highly useful, especially using node2vec in the baseline, resulting in a substantial baseline performance improvement."}

{"text": "Many modern robotics systems employ LiDAR as their main sensing modality due to its geometrical richness. Rolling shutter LiDARs are particularly common, in which an array of lasers scans the scene from a rotating base. Points are emitted as a stream of packets, each covering a sector of the 360 coverage. Modern perception algorithms wait for the full sweep to be built before processing the data, which introduces an additional latency. For typical 10Hz LiDARs this will be 100ms. As a consequence, by the time an output is produced, it no longer accurately reflects the state of the world. This poses a challenge, as robotics applications require minimal reaction times, such that maneuvers can be quickly planned in the event of a safety-critical situation. In this paper we propose StrObe, a novel approach that minimizes latency by ingesting LiDAR packets and emitting a stream of detections without waiting for the full sweep to be built. StrObe reuses computations from previous packets and iteratively updates a latent spatial representation of the scene, which acts as a memory, as new evidence comes in, resulting in accurate low-latency perception. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on a large scale real-world dataset, showing that StrObe far outperforms the state-of-the-art when latency is taken into account, and matches the performance in the traditional setting."}

First, the probabilistic contribution of each image region to the confidence of a CNN-based image classifier is computed through a backtracking strategy to produce top-down saliency. From a set of saliency maps of an image produced by fast bottom-up saliency approaches, we select the best saliency map suitable for the top-down task. The selected bottom-up saliency map is combined with the top-down saliency map. Features having high combined saliency are used to train a linear SVM classifier to estimate feature saliency. This is integrated with combined saliency and further refined through a multi-scale superpixel-averaging of saliency map. We evaluate the performance of the proposed weakly supervised topdown saliency and achieve comparable performance with fully supervised approaches. Experiments are carried out on seven challenging datasets and quantitative results are compared with 40 closely related approaches across 4 different applications."}
{"text": "The 2D object detection in clean images has been a well studied topic, but its vulnerability against adversarial attack is still worrying. Existing work has improved robustness of object detectors by adversarial training, at the same time, the average precision (AP) on clean images drops significantly. In this paper, we propose that using feature alignment of intermediate layer can improve clean AP and robustness in object detection. Further, on the basis of adversarial training, we present two feature alignment modules: Knowledge-Distilled Feature Alignment (KDFA) module and Self-Supervised Feature Alignment (SSFA) module, which can guide the network to generate more effective features. We conduct extensive experiments on PASCAL VOC and MS-COCO datasets to verify the effectiveness of our proposed approach. The code of our experiments is available at https://github.com/grispeut/Feature-Alignment.git."}
{"text": "word2vec due to Mikolov  (2013) is a word embedding method that is widely used in natural language processing. Despite its great success and frequent use, theoretical justification is still lacking. The main contribution of our paper is to propose a rigorous analysis of the highly nonlinear functional of word2vec. Our results suggest that word2vec may be primarily driven by an underlying spectral method. This insight may open the door to obtaining provable guarantees for word2vec. We support these findings by numerical simulations. One fascinating open question is whether the nonlinear properties of word2vec that are not captured by the spectral method are beneficial and, if so, by what mechanism."}
{"text": "As a notable machine learning paradigm, the research efforts in the context of reinforcement learning have certainly progressed leaps and bounds. When compared with reinforcement learning methods with the given system model, the methodology of the reinforcement learning architecture based on the unknown model generally exhibits significantly broader universality and applicability. In this work, a new reinforcement learning architecture based on iterative linear quadratic regulator (iLQR) is developed and presented without the requirement of any prior knowledge of the system model, which is termed as an approach of a \"neural network iterative linear quadratic regulator (NNiLQR)\". Depending solely on measurement data, this method yields a completely new non-parametric routine for the establishment of the optimal policy (without the necessity of system modeling) through iterative refinements of the neural network system. Rather importantly, this approach significantly outperforms the classical iLQR method in terms of the given objective function because of the innovative utilization of further exploration in the methodology. As clearly indicated from the results attained in two illustrative examples, these significant merits of the NNiLQR method are demonstrated rather evidently."}
{"text": "We extend the task of composed image retrieval, where an input query consists of an image and short textual description of how to modify the image. Existing methods have only been applied to non-complex images within narrow domains, such as fashion products, thereby limiting the scope of study on in-depth visual reasoning in rich image and language contexts. To address this issue, we collect the Compose Image Retrieval on Real-life images (CIRR) dataset, which consists of over 36,000 pairs of crowd-sourced, open-domain images with human-generated modifying text. To extend current methods to the open-domain, we propose CIRPLANT, a transformer based model that leverages rich pre-trained vision-and-language (V&L) knowledge for modifying visual features conditioned on natural language. Retrieval is then done by nearest neighbor lookup on the modified features. We demonstrate that with a relatively simple architecture, CIRPLANT outperforms existing methods on open-domain images, while matching state-of-the-art accuracy on the existing narrow datasets, such as fashion. Together with the release of CIRR, we believe this work will inspire further research on composed image retrieval."}

Malicious URLs host unsolicited content (spam, phishing, drive-by exploits, etc.) and lure unsuspecting users to become victims of scams (monetary loss, theft of private information, and malware installation), and cause losses of billions of dollars every year. It is imperative to detect and act on such threats in a timely manner. Traditionally, this detection is done mostly through the usage of blacklists. However, blacklists cannot be exhaustive, and lack the ability to detect newly generated malicious URLs. To improve the generality of malicious URL detectors, machine learning techniques have been explored with increasing attention in recent years. This article aims to provide a comprehensive survey and a structural understanding of Malicious URL Detection techniques using machine learning. We present the formal formulation of Malicious URL Detection as a machine learning task, and categorize and review the contributions of literature studies that addresses different dimensions of this problem (feature representation, algorithm design, etc.). Further, this article provides a timely and comprehensive survey for a range of different audiences, not only for machine learning researchers and engineers in academia, but also for professionals and practitioners in cybersecurity industry, to help them understand the state of the art and facilitate their own research and practical applications. We also discuss practical issues in system design, open research challenges, and point out some important directions for future research."}
{"text": "In this paper, we propose an end-to-end feature fusion at-tention network (FFA-Net) to directly restore the haze-free image. The FFA-Net architecture consists of three key components:   1) A novel Feature Attention (FA) module combines Channel Attention with Pixel Attention mechanism, considering that different channel-wise features contain totally different weighted information and haze distribution is uneven on the different image pixels. FA treats different features and pixels unequally, which provides additional flexibility in dealing with different types of information, expanding the representational ability of CNNs. 2) A basic block structure consists of Local Residual Learning and Feature Attention, Local Residual Learning allowing the less important information such as thin haze region or low-frequency to be bypassed through multiple local residual connections, let main network architecture focus on more effective information. 3) An Attention-based different levels Feature Fusion (FFA) structure, the feature weights are adaptively learned from the Feature Attention (FA) module, giving more weight to important features. This structure can also retain the information of shallow layers and pass it into deep layers.   The experimental results demonstrate that our proposed FFA-Net surpasses previous state-of-the-art single image dehazing methods by a very large margin both quantitatively and qualitatively, boosting the best published PSNR metric from 30.23db to 36.39db on the SOTS indoor test dataset.

{"text": "This paper addresses the deep face recognition problem under an open-set protocol, where ideal face features are expected to have smaller maximal intra-class distance than minimal inter-class distance under a suitably chosen metric space. To this end, hyperspherical face recognition, as a promising line of research, has attracted increasing attention and gradually become a major focus in face recognition research. As one of the earliest works in hyperspherical face recognition, SphereFace explicitly proposed to learn face embeddings with large inter-class angular margin. However, SphereFace still suffers from severe training instability which limits its application in practice. In order to address this problem, we introduce a unified framework to understand large angular margin in hyperspherical face recognition. Under this framework, we extend the study of SphereFace and propose an improved variant with substantially better training stability -- SphereFace-R. Specifically, we propose two novel ways to implement the multiplicative margin, and study SphereFace-R under three different feature normalization schemes (no feature normalization, hard feature normalization and soft feature normalization). We also propose an implementation strategy -- \"characteristic gradient detachment\" -- to stabilize training. Extensive experiments on SphereFace-R show that it is consistently better than or competitive with state-of-the-art methods."}
{"text": "Human action recognition from skeleton data, fueled by the Graph Convolutional Network (GCN), has attracted lots of attention, due to its powerful capability of modeling non-Euclidean structure data. However, many existing GCN methods provide a pre-defined graph and fix it through the entire network, which can loss implicit joint correlations. Besides, the mainstream spectral GCN is approximated by one-order hop, thus higher-order connections are not well involved. Therefore, huge efforts are required to explore a better GCN architecture. To address these problems, we turn to Neural Architecture Search (NAS) and propose the first automatically designed GCN for skeleton-based action recognition. Specifically, we enrich the search space by providing multiple dynamic graph modules after fully exploring the spatial-temporal correlations between nodes. Besides, we introduce multiple-hop modules and expect to break the limitation of representational capacity caused by one-order approximation. Moreover, a sampling- and memory-efficient evolution strategy is proposed to search an optimal architecture for this task. The resulted architecture proves the effectiveness of the higher-order approximation and the dynamic graph modeling mechanism with temporal interactions, which is barely discussed before. To evaluate the performance of the searched model, we conduct extensive experiments on two very large scaled datasets and the results show that our model gets the state-of-the-art results."}
{"text": "Attention-based scene text recognizers have gained huge success, which leverages a more compact intermediate representation to learn 1d- or 2d- attention by a RNN-based encoder-decoder architecture. However, such methods suffer from attention-drift problem because high similarity among encoded features leads to attention confusion under the RNN-based local attention mechanism. Moreover, RNN-based methods have low efficiency due to poor parallelization. To overcome these problems, we propose the MASTER, a self-attention based scene text recognizer that (1) not only encodes the input-output attention but also learns self-attention which encodes feature-feature and target-target relationships inside the encoder and decoder and (2) learns a more powerful and robust intermediate representation to spatial distortion, and (3) owns a great training efficiency because of high training parallelization and a high-speed inference because of an efficient memory-cache mechanism. Extensive experiments on various benchmarks demonstrate the superior performance of our MASTER on both regular and irregular scene text.

{"text": "Learning approaches have shown great success in the task of super-resolving an image given a low resolution input. Video super-resolution aims for exploiting additionally the information from multiple images. Typically, the images are related via optical flow and consecutive image warping. In this paper, we provide an end-to-end video super-resolution network that, in contrast to previous works, includes the estimation of optical flow in the overall network architecture. We analyze the usage of optical flow for video super-resolution and find that common off-the-shelf image warping does not allow video super-resolution to benefit much from optical flow. We rather propose an operation for motion compensation that performs warping from low to high resolution directly. We show that with this network configuration, video super-resolution can benefit from optical flow and we obtain state-of-the-art results on the popular test sets. We also show that the processing of whole images rather than independent patches is responsible for a large increase in accuracy."}

However,when applied for the analytics of histology images, few of them can effec-tively avoid the performance degradation caused by the domain discrep-ancy between the source training dataset and the target dataset, suchas different tissues, staining appearances, and imaging devices. To thisend, we present a novel method for the unsupervised domain adaptationin histopathological image analysis, based on a backbone for embeddinginput images into a feature space, and a graph neural layer for propa-gating the supervision signals of images with labels. The graph model isset up by connecting every image with its close neighbors in the embed-ded feature space. Then graph neural network is employed to synthesizenew feature representation from every image. During the training stage,target samples with confident inferences are dynamically allocated withpseudo labels. The cross-entropy loss function is used to constrain thepredictions of source samples with manually marked labels and targetsamples with pseudo labels. Furthermore, the maximum mean diversityis adopted to facilitate the extraction of domain-invariant feature repre-sentations, and contrastive learning is exploited to enhance the categorydiscrimination of learned features.

{"text": "Geometric representation learning has recently shown great promise in several machine learning settings, ranging from relational learning to language processing and generative models. In this work, we consider the problem of performing manifold-valued regression onto an hyperbolic space as an intermediate component for a number of relevant machine learning applications. In particular, by formulating the problem of predicting nodes of a tree as a manifold regression task in the hyperbolic space, we propose a novel perspective on two challenging tasks: 1) hierarchical classification via label embeddings and 2) taxonomy extension of hyperbolic representations. To address the regression problem we consider previous methods as well as proposing two novel approaches that are computationally more advantageous: a parametric deep learning model that is informed by the geodesics of the target space and a non-parametric kernel-method for which we also prove excess risk bounds. Our experiments show that the strategy of leveraging the hyperbolic geometry is promising. In particular, in the taxonomy expansion setting, we find that the hyperbolic-based estimators significantly outperform methods performing regression in the ambient Euclidean space."}
{"text": "An important pillar for safe machine learning (ML) is the systematic mitigation of weaknesses in neural networks to afford their deployment in critical applications. An ubiquitous class of safety risks are learned shortcuts, i.e. spurious correlations a network exploits for its decisions that have no semantic connection to the actual task. Networks relying on such shortcuts bear the risk of not generalizing well to unseen inputs. Explainability methods help to uncover such network vulnerabilities. However, many of these techniques are not directly applicable if access to the network is constrained, in so-called black-box setups. These setups are prevalent when using third-party ML components. To address this constraint, we present an approach to detect learned shortcuts using an interpretable-by-design network as a proxy to the black-box model of interest. Leveraging the proxy's guarantees on introspection we automatically extract candidates for learned shortcuts. Their transferability to the black box is validated in a systematic fashion. Concretely, as proxy model we choose a BagNet, which bases its decisions purely on local image patches. We demonstrate on the autonomous driving dataset A2D2 that extracted patch shortcuts significantly influence the black box model. By efficiently identifying such patch-based vulnerabilities, we contribute to safer ML models."}

Although there are several intensity invariant approaches to skin detection, the skin color of Indian sub-continentals have not been focused separately. The approach of this research is to make a comparative study between three image segmentation approaches using Indian sub-continental human images, to optimize the detection criteria, and to find some efficient parameters to detect the skin area from these images. The experiments observed that HSV color model based approach to Indian sub-continental skin detection is more suitable with considerable success rate of 91.1% true positives and 88.1% true negatives."}

{"text": "Fooling people with highly realistic fake images generated with Deepfake or GANs brings a great social disturbance to our society. Many methods have been proposed to detect fake images, but they are vulnerable to adversarial perturbations -- intentionally designed noises that can lead to the wrong prediction. Existing methods of attacking fake image detectors usually generate adversarial perturbations to perturb almost the entire image. This is redundant and increases the perceptibility of perturbations. In this paper, we propose a novel method to disrupt the fake image detection by determining key pixels to a fake image detector and attacking only the key pixels, which results in the L_0 and the L_2 norms of adversarial perturbations much less than those of existing works. Experiments on two public datasets with three fake image detectors indicate that our proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance in both white-box and black-box attacks."}
{"text": "3D perception using sensors under vehicle industrial standard is the rigid demand in autonomous driving. MEMS LiDAR emerges with irresistible trend due to its lower cost, more robust, and meeting the mass-production standards. However, it suffers small field of view (FoV), slowing down the step of its population. In this paper, we propose LEAD, i.e., LiDAR Extender for Autonomous Driving, to extend the MEMS LiDAR by coupled image w.r.t both FoV and range. We propose a multi-stage propagation strategy based on depth distributions and uncertainty map, which shows effective propagation ability. Moreover, our depth outpainting/propagation network follows a teacher-student training fashion, which transfers depth estimation ability to depth completion network without any scale error passed. To validate the LiDAR extension quality, we utilize a high-precise laser scanner to generate a ground-truth dataset. Quantitative and qualitative evaluations show that our scheme outperforms SOTAs with a large margin. We believe the proposed LEAD along with the dataset would benefit the community w.r.t depth researches."}

In an extensive evaluation on five standard datasets, we show that our student has small accuracy drop, achieves better performance than other knowledge transfer approaches and it surpasses the performance of the same network trained with labels. In addition, we demonstrate state-of-the-art results compared to other compression strategies."}
{"text": "We study the task of conversational fashion image retrieval via multiturn natural language feedback. Most previous studies are based on single-turn settings. Existing models on multiturn conversational fashion image retrieval have limitations, such as employing traditional models, and leading to ineffective performance. We propose a novel framework that can effectively handle conversational fashion image retrieval with multiturn natural language feedback texts. One characteristic of the framework is that it searches for candidate images based on exploitation of the encoded reference image and feedback text information together with the conversation history. Furthermore, the image fashion attribute information is leveraged via a mutual attention strategy. Since there is no existing fashion dataset suitable for the multiturn setting of our task, we derive a large-scale multiturn fashion dataset via additional manual annotation efforts on an existing single-turn dataset. The experiments show that our proposed model significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods."}
{"text": "Pose tracking is an important problem that requires identifying unique human pose-instances and matching them temporally across different frames of a video. However, existing pose tracking methods are unable to accurately model temporal relationships and require significant computation, often computing the tracks offline. We present an efficient Multi-person Pose Tracking method, KeyTrack, that only relies on keypoint information without using any RGB or optical flow information to track human keypoints in real-time. Keypoints are tracked using our Pose Entailment method, in which, first, a pair of pose estimates is sampled from different frames in a video and tokenized. Then, a Transformer-based network makes a binary classification as to whether one pose temporally follows another. Furthermore, we improve our top-down pose estimation method with a novel, parameter-free, keypoint refinement technique that improves the keypoint estimates used during the Pose Entailment step. We achieve state-of-the-art results on the PoseTrack'17 and the PoseTrack'18 benchmarks while using only a fraction of the computation required by most other methods for computing the tracking information."}
{"text": "Early classification of time series has been extensively studied for minimizing class prediction delay in time-sensitive applications such as healthcare and finance. A primary task of an early classification approach is to classify an incomplete time series as soon as possible with some desired level of accuracy. Recent years have witnessed several approaches for early classification of time series. As most of the approaches have solved the early classification problem with different aspects, it becomes very important to make a thorough review of the existing solutions to know the current status of the area. These solutions have demonstrated reasonable performance in a wide range of applications including human activity recognition, gene expression based health diagnostic, industrial monitoring, and so on. In this paper, we present a systematic review of current literature on early classification approaches for both univariate and multivariate time series. We divide various existing approaches into four exclusive categories based on their proposed solution strategies. The four categories include prefix based, shapelet based, model based, and miscellaneous approaches. The authors also discuss the applications of early classification in many areas including industrial monitoring, intelligent transportation, and medical.

{"text": "With the proliferation of social media, fashion inspired from celebrities, reputed designers as well as fashion influencers has shortened the cycle of fashion design and manufacturing. However, with the explosion of fashion related content and large number of user generated fashion photos, it is an arduous task for fashion designers to wade through social media photos and create a digest of trending fashion. This necessitates deep parsing of fashion photos on social media to localize and classify multiple fashion items from a given fashion photo. While object detection competitions such as MSCOCO have thousands of samples for each of the object categories, it is quite difficult to get large labeled datasets for fast fashion items. Moreover, state-of-the-art object detectors do not have any functionality to ingest large amount of unlabeled data available on social media in order to fine tune object detectors with labeled datasets. In this work, we show application of a generic object detector, that can be pretrained in an unsupervised manner, on 24 categories from recently released Open Images V4 dataset. We first train the base architecture of the object detector using unsupervisd learning on 60K unlabeled photos from 24 categories gathered from social media, and then subsequently fine tune it on 8.2K labeled photos from Open Images V4 dataset. On 300 X 300 image inputs, we achieve 72.7% mAP on a test dataset of 2.4K photos while performing 11% to 17% better as compared to the state-of-the-art object detectors. We show that this improvement is due to our choice of architecture that lets us do unsupervised learning and that performs significantly better in identifying small objects."}
{"text": "Prior studies show that the key to face anti-spoofing lies in the subtle image pattern, termed \"spoof trace\", e.g., color distortion, 3D mask edge, Moire pattern, and many others. Designing a generic face anti-spoofing model to estimate those spoof traces can improve not only the generalization of the spoof detection, but also the interpretability of the model's decision. Yet, this is a challenging task due to the diversity of spoof types and the lack of ground truth in spoof traces. In this work, we design a novel adversarial learning framework to disentangle spoof faces into the spoof traces and the live counterparts. Guided by physical properties, the spoof generation is represented as a combination of additive process and inpainting process. Additive process describes spoofing as spoof material introducing extra patterns (e.g., moire pattern), where the live counterpart can be recovered by removing those patterns. Inpainting process describes spoofing as spoof material fully covering certain regions, where the live counterpart of those regions has to be \"guessed\". We use 3 additive components and 1 inpainting component to represent traces at different frequency bands. The disentangled spoof traces can be utilized to synthesize realistic new spoof faces after proper geometric correction, and the synthesized spoof can be used for training and improve the generalization of spoof detection. Our approach demonstrates superior spoof detection performance on 3 testing scenarios: known attacks, unknown attacks, and open-set attacks. Meanwhile, it provides a visually-convincing estimation of the spoof traces. Source code and pre-trained models will be publicly available upon publication."}
{"text": "In this paper, we propose an access control method that uses the spatially invariant permutation of feature maps with a secret key for protecting semantic segmentation models. Segmentation models are trained and tested by permuting selected feature maps with a secret key. The proposed method allows rightful users with the correct key not only to access a model to full capacity but also to degrade the performance for unauthorized users. Conventional access control methods have focused only on image classification tasks, and these methods have never been applied to semantic segmentation tasks. In an experiment, the protected models were demonstrated to allow rightful users to obtain almost the same performance as that of non-protected models but also to be robust against access by unauthorized users without a key. In addition, a conventional method with block-wise transformations was also verified to have degraded performance under semantic segmentation models."}
{"text": "In a traditional convolutional layer, the learned filters stay fixed after training. In contrast, we introduce a new framework, the Dynamic Filter Network, where filters are generated dynamically conditioned on an input. We show that this architecture is a powerful one, with increased flexibility thanks to its adaptive nature, yet without an excessive increase in the number of model parameters. A wide variety of filtering operations can be learned this way, including local spatial transformations, but also others like selective (de)blurring or adaptive feature extraction. Moreover, multiple such layers can be combined, e.g. in a recurrent architecture. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the dynamic filter network on the tasks of video and stereo prediction, and reach state-of-the-art performance on the moving MNIST dataset with a much smaller model. By visualizing the learned filters, we illustrate that the network has picked up flow information by only looking at unlabelled training data. This suggests that the network can be used to pretrain networks for various supervised tasks in an unsupervised way, like optical flow and depth estimation."}
{"text": "We present an extension to the model-free anomaly detection algorithm, Isolation Forest. This extension, named Extended Isolation Forest (EIF), resolves issues with assignment of anomaly score to given data points. We motivate the problem using heat maps for anomaly scores. These maps suffer from artifacts generated by the criteria for branching operation of the binary tree. We explain this problem in detail and demonstrate the mechanism by which it occurs visually. We then propose two different approaches for improving the situation. First we propose transforming the data randomly before creation of each tree, which results in averaging out the bias. Second, which is the preferred way, is to allow the slicing of the data to use hyperplanes with random slopes. This approach results in remedying the artifact seen in the anomaly score heat maps. We show that the robustness of the algorithm is much improved using this method by looking at the variance of scores of data points distributed along constant level sets. We report AUROC and AUPRC for our synthetic datasets, along with real-world benchmark datasets. We find no appreciable difference in the rate of convergence nor in computation time between the standard Isolation Forest and EIF."}
{"text": "We propose a novel attention model that can accurately attends to target objects of various scales and shapes in images. The model is trained to gradually suppress irrelevant regions in an input image via a progressive attentive process over multiple layers of a convolutional neural network. The attentive process in each layer determines whether to pass or block features at certain spatial locations for use in the subsequent layers. The proposed progressive attention mechanism works well especially when combined with hard attention. We further employ local contexts to incorporate neighborhood features of each location and estimate a better attention probability map. The experiments on synthetic and real datasets show that the proposed attention networks outperform traditional attention methods in visual attribute prediction tasks."}
{"text": "Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have achieved tremendous success in graph representation learning. Unfortunately, current GNNs usually rely on loading the entire attributed graph into network for processing. This implicit assumption may not be satisfied with limited memory resources, especially when the attributed graph is large. In this paper, we pioneer to propose a Binary Graph Convolutional Network (Bi-GCN), which binarizes both the network parameters and input node features. Besides, the original matrix multiplications are revised to binary operations for accelerations. According to the theoretical analysis, our Bi-GCN can reduce the memory consumption by an average of ~30x for both the network parameters and input data, and accelerate the inference speed by an average of ~47x, on the citation networks. Meanwhile, we also design a new gradient approximation based back-propagation method to train our Bi-GCN well. Extensive experiments have demonstrated that our Bi-GCN can give a comparable performance compared to the full-precision baselines. Besides, our binarization approach can be easily applied to other GNNs, which has been verified in the experiments."}
{"text": "Single Image Super-Resolution (SISR) task refers to learn a mapping from low-resolution images to the corresponding high-resolution ones. This task is known to be extremely difficult since it is an ill-posed problem. Recently, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have achieved state of the art performance on SISR. However, the images produced by CNNs do not contain fine details of the images. Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) aim to solve this issue and recover sharp details. Nevertheless, GANs are notoriously difficult to train. Besides that, they generate artifacts in the high-resolution images. In this paper, we have proposed a method in which CNNs try to align images in different spaces rather than only the pixel space. Such a space is designed using convex optimization techniques. CNNs are encouraged to learn high-frequency components of the images as well as low-frequency components. We have shown that the proposed method can recover fine details of the images and it is stable in the training process."}
{"text": "Multi-label image and video classification are fundamental yet challenging tasks in computer vision. The main challenges lie in capturing spatial or temporal dependencies between labels and discovering the locations of discriminative features for each class. In order to overcome these challenges, we propose to use cross-modality attention with semantic graph embedding for multi label classification. Based on the constructed label graph, we propose an adjacency-based similarity graph embedding method to learn semantic label embeddings, which explicitly exploit label relationships. Then our novel cross-modality attention maps are generated with the guidance of learned label embeddings. Experiments on two multi-label image classification datasets (MS-COCO and NUS-WIDE) show our method outperforms other existing state-of-the-arts. In addition, we validate our method on a large multi-label video classification dataset (YouTube-8M Segments) and the evaluation results demonstrate the generalization capability of our method."}
{"text": "Given an incomplete image without additional constraint, image inpainting natively allows for multiple solutions as long as they appear plausible. Recently, multiplesolution inpainting methods have been proposed and shown the potential of generating diverse results. However, these methods have difficulty in ensuring the quality of each solution, e.g. they produce distorted structure and/or blurry texture. We propose a two-stage model for diverse inpainting, where the first stage generates multiple coarse results each of which has a different structure, and the second stage refines each coarse result separately by augmenting texture. The proposed model is inspired by the hierarchical vector quantized variational auto-encoder (VQ-VAE), whose hierarchical architecture isentangles structural and textural information. In addition, the vector quantization in VQVAE enables autoregressive modeling of the discrete distribution over the structural information. Sampling from the distribution can easily generate diverse and high-quality structures, making up the first stage of our model. In the second stage, we propose a structural attention module inside the texture generation network, where the module utilizes the structural information to capture distant correlations. We further reuse the VQ-VAE to calculate two feature losses, which help improve structure coherence and texture realism, respectively. Experimental results on CelebA-HQ, Places2, and ImageNet datasets show that our method not only enhances the diversity of the inpainting solutions but also improves the visual quality of the generated multiple images.

Due to the strip shape of the chromosomes, they easily get overlapped with each other when imaged, significantly affecting the accuracy of the analysis afterward. Conventional overlapping chromosome segmentation methods are usually based on manually tagged features, hence, the performance of which is easily affected by the quality, such as resolution and brightness, of the images. To address the problem, in this paper, we present an adversarial multiscale feature learning framework to improve the accuracy and adaptability of overlapping chromosome segmentation. Specifically, we first adopt the nested U-shape network with dense skip connections as the generator to explore the optimal representation of the chromosome images by exploiting multiscale features. Then we use the conditional generative adversarial network (cGAN) to generate images similar to the original ones, the training stability of which is enhanced by applying the least-square GAN objective. Finally, we employ Lovasz-Softmax to help the model converge in a continuous optimization setting. Comparing with the established algorithms, the performance of our framework is proven superior by using public datasets in eight evaluation criteria, showing its great potential in overlapping chromosome segmentation"}
{"text": "We propose a novel and unsupervised representation learning model, i.e., Robust Block-Diagonal Adaptive Locality-constrained Latent Representation (rBDLR). rBDLR is able to recover multi-subspace structures and extract the adaptive locality-preserving salient features jointly. Leveraging on the Frobenius-norm based latent low-rank representation model, rBDLR jointly learns the coding coefficients and salient features, and improves the results by enhancing the robustness to outliers and errors in given data, preserving local information of salient features adaptively and ensuring the block-diagonal structures of the coefficients. To improve the robustness, we perform the latent representation and adaptive weighting in a recovered clean data space. To force the coefficients to be block-diagonal, we perform auto-weighting by minimizing the reconstruction error based on salient features, constrained using a block-diagonal regularizer. This ensures that a strict block-diagonal weight matrix can be obtained and salient features will possess the adaptive locality preserving ability. By minimizing the difference between the coefficient and weights matrices, we can obtain a block-diagonal coefficients matrix and it can also propagate and exchange useful information between salient features and coefficients. Extensive results demonstrate the superiority of rBDLR over other state-of-the-art methods."}
{"text": "For domain generalization (DG) and unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA), cross domain feature alignment has been widely explored to pull the feature distributions of different domains in order to learn domain-invariant representations. However, the feature alignment is in general task-ignorant and could result in degradation of the discrimination power of the feature representation and thus hinders the high performance. In this paper, we propose a unified framework termed Feature Alignment and Restoration (FAR) to simultaneously ensure high generalization and discrimination power of the networks for effective DG and UDA. Specifically, we perform feature alignment (FA) across domains by aligning the moments of the distributions of attentively selected features to reduce their discrepancy. To ensure high discrimination, we propose a Feature Restoration (FR) operation to distill task-relevant features from the residual information and use them to compensate for the aligned features. For better disentanglement, we enforce a dual ranking entropy loss constraint in the FR step to encourage the separation of task-relevant and task-irrelevant features. Extensive experiments on multiple classification benchmarks demonstrate the high performance and strong generalization of our FAR framework for both domain generalization and unsupervised domain adaptation."}
{"text": "Generating point clouds, e.g., molecular structures, in arbitrary rotations, translations, and enumerations remains a challenging task. Meanwhile, neural networks utilizing symmetry invariant layers have been shown to be able to optimize their training objective in a data-efficient way. In this spirit, we present an architecture which allows to produce valid Euclidean distance matrices, which by construction are already invariant under rotation and translation of the described object. Motivated by the goal to generate molecular structures in Cartesian space, we use this architecture to construct a Wasserstein GAN utilizing a permutation invariant critic network. This makes it possible to generate molecular structures in a one-shot fashion by producing Euclidean distance matrices which have a three-dimensional embedding."}
{"text": "In many machine learning tasks, learning a good representation of the data can be the key to building a well-performant solution. This is because most learning algorithms operate with the features in order to find models for the data. For instance, classification performance can improve if the data is mapped to a space where classes are easily separated, and regression can be facilitated by finding a manifold of data in the feature space. As a general rule, features are transformed by means of statistical methods such as principal component analysis, or manifold learning techniques such as Isomap or locally linear embedding. From a plethora of representation learning methods, one of the most versatile tools is the autoencoder. In this paper we aim to demonstrate how to influence its learned representations to achieve the desired learning behavior. To this end, we present a series of learning tasks: data embedding for visualization, image denoising, semantic hashing, detection of abnormal behaviors and instance generation. We model them from the representation learning perspective, following the state of the art methodologies in each field. A solution is proposed for each task employing autoencoders as the only learning method. The theoretical developments are put into practice using a selection of datasets for the different problems and implementing each solution, followed by a discussion of the results in each case study and a brief explanation of other six learning applications. We also explore the current challenges and approaches to explainability in the context of autoencoders. All of this helps conclude that, thanks to alterations in their structure as well as their objective function, autoencoders may be the core of a possible solution to many problems which can be modeled as a transformation of the feature space."}
{"text": "Predicting the dependencies between observations from multiple time series is critical for applications such as anomaly detection, financial risk management, causal analysis, or demand forecasting. However, the computational and numerical difficulties of estimating time-varying and high-dimensional covariance matrices often limits existing methods to handling at most a few hundred dimensions or requires making strong assumptions on the dependence between series. We propose to combine an RNN-based time series model with a Gaussian copula process output model with a low-rank covariance structure to reduce the computational complexity and handle non-Gaussian marginal distributions. This permits to drastically reduce the number of parameters and consequently allows the modeling of time-varying correlations of thousands of time series. We show on several real-world datasets that our method provides significant accuracy improvements over state-of-the-art baselines and perform an ablation study analyzing the contributions of the different components of our model."}
{"text": "A common workflow in data exploration is to learn a low-dimensional representation of the data, identify groups of points in that representation, and examine the differences between the groups to determine what they represent. We treat this workflow as an interpretable machine learning problem by leveraging the model that learned the low-dimensional representation to help identify the key differences between the groups. To solve this problem, we introduce a new type of explanation, a Global Counterfactual Explanation (GCE), and our algorithm, Transitive Global Translations (TGT), for computing GCEs. TGT identifies the differences between each pair of groups using compressed sensing but constrains those pairwise differences to be consistent among all of the groups. Empirically, we demonstrate that TGT is able to identify explanations that accurately explain the model while being relatively sparse, and that these explanations match real patterns in the data."}
{"text": "With the increasing adoption of AI, inherent security and privacy vulnerabilities formachine learning systems are being discovered. One such vulnerability makes itpossible for an adversary to obtain private information about the types of instancesused to train the targeted machine learning model. This so-called model inversionattack is based on sequential leveraging of classification scores towards obtaininghigh confidence representations for various classes. However, for deep networks,such procedures usually lead to unrecognizable representations that are uselessfor the adversary. In this paper, we introduce a more realistic definition of modelinversion, where the adversary is aware of the general purpose of the attackedmodel (for instance, whether it is an OCR system or a facial recognition system),and the goal is to find realistic class representations within the corresponding lower-dimensional manifold (of, respectively, general symbols or general faces). To thatend, we leverage properties of generative adversarial networks for constructinga connected lower-dimensional manifold, and demonstrate the efficiency of ourmodel inversion attack that is carried out within that manifold."}
{"text": "In this paper, we propose a new global analysis framework for a class of low-rank matrix recovery problems on the Riemannian manifold. We analyze the global behavior for the Riemannian optimization with random initialization. We use the Riemannian gradient descent algorithm to minimize a least squares loss function, and study the asymptotic behavior as well as the exact convergence rate. We reveal a previously unknown geometric property of the low-rank matrix manifold, which is the existence of spurious critical points for the simple least squares function on the manifold. We show that under some assumptions, the Riemannian gradient descent starting from a random initialization with high probability avoids these spurious critical points and only converges to the ground truth in nearly linear convergence rate, i.e. (\\text(\\frac)+ \\text(n)) iterations to reach an \\epsilon-accurate solution. We use two applications as examples for our global analysis. The first one is a rank-1 matrix recovery problem. The second one is a generalization of the Gaussian phase retrieval problem. It only satisfies the weak isometry property, but has behavior similar to that of the first one except for an extra saddle set. Our convergence guarantee is nearly optimal and almost dimension-free, which fully explains the numerical observations. The global analysis can be potentially extended to other data problems with random measurement structures and empirical least squares loss functions."}

{"text": "Preparing and scanning histopathology slides consists of several steps, each with a multitude of parameters. The parameters can vary between pathology labs and within the same lab over time, resulting in significant variability of the tissue appearance that hampers the generalization of automatic image analysis methods. Typically, this is addressed with ad-hoc approaches such as staining normalization that aim to reduce the appearance variability. In this paper, we propose a systematic solution based on domain-adversarial neural networks. We hypothesize that removing the domain information from the model representation leads to better generalization. We tested our hypothesis for the problem of mitosis detection in breast cancer histopathology images and made a comparative analysis with two other approaches. We show that combining color augmentation with domain-adversarial training is a better alternative than standard approaches to improve the generalization of deep learning methods."}
{"text": "We propose to use boosted regression trees as a way to compute human-interpretable solutions to reinforcement learning problems. Boosting combines several regression trees to improve their accuracy without significantly reducing their inherent interpretability. Prior work has focused independently on reinforcement learning and on interpretable machine learning, but there has been little progress in interpretable reinforcement learning. Our experimental results show that boosted regression trees compute solutions that are both interpretable and match the quality of leading reinforcement learning methods."}
{"text": "Image interpolation, or image morphing, refers to a visual transition between two (or more) input images. For such a transition to look visually appealing, its desirable properties are (i) to be smooth; (ii) to apply the minimal required change in the image; and (iii) to seem \"real\", avoiding unnatural artifacts in each image in the transition. To obtain a smooth and straightforward transition, one may adopt the well-known Wasserstein Barycenter Problem (WBP). While this approach guarantees minimal changes under the Wasserstein metric, the resulting images might seem unnatural. In this work, we propose a novel approach for image morphing that possesses all three desired properties. To this end, we define a constrained variant of the WBP that enforces the intermediate images to satisfy an image prior. We describe an algorithm that solves this problem and demonstrate it using the sparse prior and generative adversarial networks."}
{"text": "Deep clustering algorithms combine representation learning and clustering by jointly optimizing a clustering loss and a non-clustering loss. In such methods, a deep neural network is used for representation learning together with a clustering network. Instead of following this framework to improve clustering performance, we propose a simpler approach of optimizing the entanglement of the learned latent code representation of an autoencoder. We define entanglement as how close pairs of points from the same class or structure are, relative to pairs of points from different classes or structures. To measure the entanglement of data points, we use the soft nearest neighbor loss, and expand it by introducing an annealing temperature factor. Using our proposed approach, the test clustering accuracy was 96.2% on the MNIST dataset, 85.6% on the Fashion-MNIST dataset, and 79.2% on the EMNIST Balanced dataset, outperforming our baseline models."}
{"text": "This paper proposes to learn hierarchical compositional AND-OR model for interpretable image synthesis by sparsifying the generator network. The proposed method adopts the scene-objects-parts-subparts-primitives hierarchy in image representation. A scene has different types (i.e., OR) each of which consists of a number of objects (i.e., AND). This can be recursively formulated across the scene-objects-parts-subparts hierarchy and is terminated at the primitive level (e.g., wavelets-like basis). To realize this AND-OR hierarchy in image synthesis, we learn a generator network that consists of the following two components: (i) Each layer of the hierarchy is represented by an over-complete set of convolutional basis functions. Off-the-shelf convolutional neural architectures are exploited to implement the hierarchy. (ii) Sparsity-inducing constraints are introduced in end-to-end training, which induces a sparsely activated and sparsely connected AND-OR model from the initially densely connected generator network. A straightforward sparsity-inducing constraint is utilized, that is to only allow the top-k basis functions to be activated at each layer (where k is a hyper-parameter). The learned basis functions are also capable of image reconstruction to explain the input images. In experiments, the proposed method is tested on four benchmark datasets. The results show that meaningful and interpretable hierarchical representations are learned with better qualities of image synthesis and reconstruction obtained than baselines."}
{"text": "Current benchmarks for optical flow algorithms evaluate the estimation either directly by comparing the predicted flow fields with the ground truth or indirectly by using the predicted flow fields for frame interpolation and then comparing the interpolated frames with the actual frames. In the latter case, objective quality measures such as the mean squared error are typically employed. However, it is well known that for image quality assessment, the actual quality experienced by the user cannot be fully deduced from such simple measures. Hence, we conducted a subjective quality assessment crowdscouring study for the interpolated frames provided by one of the optical flow benchmarks, the Middlebury benchmark. We collected forced-choice paired comparisons between interpolated images and corresponding ground truth. To increase the sensitivity of observers when judging minute difference in paired comparisons we introduced a new method to the field of full-reference quality assessment, called artefact amplification. From the crowdsourcing data, we reconstructed absolute quality scale values according to Thurstone's model. As a result, we obtained a re-ranking of the 155 participating algorithms w.r.t. the visual quality of the interpolated frames. This re-ranking not only shows the necessity of visual quality assessment as another evaluation metric for optical flow and frame interpolation benchmarks, the results also provide the ground truth for designing novel image quality assessment (IQA) methods dedicated to perceptual quality of interpolated images. As a first step, we proposed such a new full-reference method, called WAE-IQA. By weighing the local differences between an interpolated image and its ground truth WAE-IQA performed slightly better than the currently best FR-IQA approach from the literature."}
{"text": "Developing an automated vehicle, that can handle complicated driving scenarios and appropriately interact with other road users, requires the ability to semantically learn and understand driving environment, oftentimes, based on analyzing massive amounts of naturalistic driving data. An important paradigm that allows automated vehicles to both learn from human drivers and gain insights is understanding the principal compositions of the entire traffic, termed as traffic primitives. However, the exploding data growth presents a great challenge in extracting primitives from high-dimensional time-series traffic data with various types of road users engaged. Therefore, automatically extracting primitives is becoming one of the cost-efficient ways to help autonomous vehicles understand and predict the complex traffic scenarios. In addition, the extracted primitives from raw data should 1) be appropriate for automated driving applications and also 2) be easily used to generate new traffic scenarios. However, existing literature does not provide a method to automatically learn these primitives from large-scale traffic data. The contribution of this paper has two manifolds. The first one is that we proposed a new framework to generate new traffic scenarios from a handful of limited traffic data. The second one is that we introduce a nonparametric Bayesian learning method -- a sticky hierarchical Dirichlet process hidden Markov model -- to automatically extract primitives from multidimensional traffic data without prior knowledge of the primitive settings. The developed method is then validated using one day of naturalistic driving data. Experiment results show that the nonparametric Bayesian learning method is able to extract primitives from traffic scenarios where both the binary and continuous events coexist."}
{"text": "We introduce a collection of datasets from fundamental physics research -- including particle physics, astroparticle physics, and hadron- and nuclear physics -- for supervised machine learning studies. These datasets, containing hadronic top quarks, cosmic-ray induced air showers, phase transitions in hadronic matter, and generator-level histories, are made public to simplify future work on cross-disciplinary machine learning and transfer learning in fundamental physics. Based on these data, we present a simple yet flexible graph-based neural network architecture that can easily be applied to a wide range of supervised learning tasks in these domains. We show that our approach reaches performance close to state-of-the-art dedicated methods on all datasets. To simplify adaptation for various problems, we provide easy-to-follow instructions on how graph-based representations of data structures, relevant for fundamental physics, can be constructed and provide code implementations for several of them. Implementations are also provided for our proposed method and all reference algorithms."}
{"text": "We address the problem of estimating a high quality dense depth map from a single RGB input image. We start out with a baseline encoder-decoder convolutional neural network architecture and pose the question of how the global processing of information can help improve overall depth estimation. To this end, we propose a transformer-based architecture block that divides the depth range into bins whose center value is estimated adaptively per image. The final depth values are estimated as linear combinations of the bin centers. We call our new building block AdaBins. Our results show a decisive improvement over the state-of-the-art on several popular depth datasets across all metrics. We also validate the effectiveness of the proposed block with an ablation study and provide the code and corresponding pre-trained weights of the new state-of-the-art model."}
{"text": "Time-lagged autoencoders (TAEs) have been proposed as a deep learning regression-based approach to the discovery of slow modes in dynamical systems. However, a rigorous analysis of nonlinear TAEs remains lacking. In this work, we discuss the capabilities and limitations of TAEs through both theoretical and numerical analyses. Theoretically, we derive bounds for nonlinear TAE performance in slow mode discovery and show that in general TAEs learn a mixture of slow and maximum variance modes. Numerically, we illustrate cases where TAEs can and cannot correctly identify the leading slowest mode in two example systems: a 2D \"Washington beltway\" potential and the alanine dipeptide molecule in explicit water. We also compare the TAE results with those obtained using state-free reversible VAMPnets (SRVs) as a variational-based neural network approach for slow modes discovery, and show that SRVs can correctly discover slow modes where TAEs fail."}
{"text": "We present two new metrics for evaluating generative models in the class-conditional image generation setting. These metrics are obtained by generalizing the two most popular unconditional metrics: the Inception Score (IS) and the Fre'chet Inception Distance (FID). A theoretical analysis shows the motivation behind each proposed metric and links the novel metrics to their unconditional counterparts. The link takes the form of a product in the case of IS or an upper bound in the FID case. We provide an extensive empirical evaluation, comparing the metrics to their unconditional variants and to other metrics, and utilize them to analyze existing generative models, thus providing additional insights about their performance, from unlearned classes to mode collapse."}
{"text": "Increased availability of electronic health records (EHR) has enabled researchers to study various medical questions. Cohort selection for the hypothesis under investigation is one of the main consideration for EHR analysis. For uncommon diseases, cohorts extracted from EHRs contain very limited number of records - hampering the robustness of any analysis. Data augmentation methods have been successfully applied in other domains to address this issue mainly using simulated records. In this paper, we present ODVICE, a data augmentation framework that leverages the medical concept ontology to systematically augment records using a novel ontologically guided Monte-Carlo graph spanning algorithm. The tool allows end users to specify a small set of interactive controls to control the augmentation process. We analyze the importance of ODVICE by conducting studies on MIMIC-III dataset for two learning tasks. Our results demonstrate the predictive performance of ODVICE augmented cohorts, showing ~30% improvement in area under the curve (AUC) over the non-augmented dataset and other data augmentation strategies."}
{"text": "The aim of this paper is to introduce two widely applicable regularization methods based on the direct modification of weight matrices. The first method, Weight Reinitialization, utilizes a simplified Bayesian assumption with partially resetting a sparse subset of the parameters.

The proposed methods are evaluated on benchmark datasets, such as MNIST, CIFAR-10 or the JSB Chorales database, and also on time series modeling tasks. We report gains both regarding performance and entropy of the analyzed networks. We also made our code available as a GitHub repository (https://github.com/rpatrik96/lod-wmm-2019)."}

{"text": "The mainstream image captioning models rely on Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) image features to generate captions via recurrent models. Recently, image scene graphs have been used to augment captioning models so as to leverage their structural semantics, such as object entities, relationships and attributes. Several studies have noted that the naive use of scene graphs from a black-box scene graph generator harms image captioning performance and that scene graph-based captioning models have to incur the overhead of explicit use of image features to generate decent captions. Addressing these challenges, we propose \\textbf, a framework that utilizes only the scene graph labels for competitive image captioning performance. The basic idea is to close the semantic gap between the two scene graphs - one derived from the input image and the other from its caption. In order to achieve this, we leverage the spatial location of objects and the Human-Object-Interaction (HOI) labels as an additional HOI graph. SG2Caps outperforms existing scene graph-only captioning models by a large margin, indicating scene graphs as a promising representation for image captioning. Direct utilization of scene graph labels avoids expensive graph convolutions over high-dimensional CNN features resulting in 49% fewer trainable parameters.

{"text": "Semantic segmentation using fine-resolution remotely sensed images plays a critical role in many practical applications, such as urban planning, environmental protection, natural and anthropogenic landscape monitoring, etc. However, the automation of semantic segmentation, i.e., automatic categorization/labeling and segmentation is still a challenging task, particularly for fine-resolution images with huge spatial and spectral complexity. Addressing such a problem represents an exciting research field, which paves the way for scene-level landscape pattern analysis and decision making. In this paper, we propose an approach for automatic land segmentation based on the Feature Pyramid Network (FPN). As a classic architecture, FPN can build a feature pyramid with high-level semantics throughout. However, intrinsic defects in feature extraction and fusion hinder FPN from further aggregating more discriminative features. Hence, we propose an Attention Aggregation Module (AAM) to enhance multi-scale feature learning through attention-guided feature aggregation. Based on FPN and AAM, a novel framework named Attention Aggregation Feature Pyramid Network (A2-FPN) is developed for semantic segmentation of fine-resolution remotely sensed images. Extensive experiments conducted on three datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our A2 -FPN in segmentation accuracy. Code is available at https://github.com/lironui/A2-FPN."}
{"text": "Improving sample efficiency is a key research problem in reinforcement learning (RL), and CURL, which uses contrastive learning to extract high-level features from raw pixels of individual video frames, is an efficient algorithm~\\citep. We observe that consecutive video frames in a game are highly correlated but CURL deals with them independently. To further improve data efficiency, we propose a new algorithm, masked contrastive representation learning for RL, that takes the correlation among consecutive inputs into consideration. In addition to the CNN encoder and the policy network in CURL, our method introduces an auxiliary Transformer module to leverage the correlations among video frames. During training, we randomly mask the features of several frames, and use the CNN encoder and Transformer to reconstruct them based on the context frames. The CNN encoder and Transformer are jointly trained via contrastive learning where the reconstructed features should be similar to the ground-truth ones while dissimilar to others. During inference, the CNN encoder and the policy network are used to take actions, and the Transformer module is discarded. Our method achieves consistent improvements over CURL on 14 out of 16 environments from DMControl suite and 21 out of 26 environments from Atari 2600 Games.

{"text": "Recently there has been increased interest in semi-supervised classification in the presence of graphical information. A new class of learning models has emerged that relies, at its most basic level, on classifying the data after first applying a graph convolution. To understand the merits of this approach, we study the classification of a mixture of Gaussians, where the data corresponds to the node attributes of a stochastic block model. We show that graph convolution extends the regime in which the data is linearly separable by a factor of roughly 1/, where D is the expected degree of a node, as compared to the mixture model data on its own. Furthermore, we find that the linear classifier obtained by minimizing the cross-entropy loss after the graph convolution generalizes to out-of-distribution data where the unseen data can have different intra- and inter-class edge probabilities from the training data."}
{"text": "We introduce a variational method for multi-view shape-from-shading under natural illumination. The key idea is to couple PDE-based solutions for single-image based shape-from-shading problems across multiple images and multiple color channels by means of a variational formulation. Rather than alternatingly solving the individual SFS problems and optimizing the consistency across images and channels which is known to lead to suboptimal results, we propose an efficient solution of the coupled problem by means of an ADMM algorithm. In numerous experiments on both simulated and real imagery, we demonstrate that the proposed fusion of multiple-view reconstruction and shape-from-shading provides highly accurate dense reconstructions without the need to compute dense correspondences. With the proposed variational integration across multiple views shape-from-shading techniques become applicable to challenging real-world reconstruction problems, giving rise to highly detailed geometry even in areas of smooth brightness variation and lacking texture."}
{"text": "With the advents of deep learning, improved image classification with complex discriminative models has been made possible. However, such deep models with increased complexity require a huge set of labeled samples to generalize the training. Such classification models can easily overfit when applied for medical images because of limited training data, which is a common problem in the field of medical image analysis. This paper proposes and investigates a reinforced classifier for improving the generalization under a few available training data. Partially following the idea of reinforcement learning, the proposed classifier uses a generalization-feedback from a subset of the training data to update its parameter instead of only using the conventional cross-entropy loss about the training data. We evaluate the improvement of the proposed classifier by applying it on three different classification problems against the standard deep classifiers equipped with existing overfitting-prevention techniques. Besides an overall improvement in classification performance, the proposed classifier showed remarkable characteristics of generalized learning, which can have great potential in medical classification tasks."}
{"text": "FPN-based detectors have made significant progress in general object detection, e.g., MS COCO and PASCAL VOC. However, these detectors fail in certain application scenarios, e.g., tiny object detection. In this paper, we argue that the top-down connections between adjacent layers in FPN bring two-side influences for tiny object detection, not only positive. We propose a novel concept, fusion factor, to control information that deep layers deliver to shallow layers, for adapting FPN to tiny object detection. After series of experiments and analysis, we explore how to estimate an effective value of fusion factor for a particular dataset by a statistical method. The estimation is dependent on the number of objects distributed in each layer. Comprehensive experiments are conducted on tiny object detection datasets, e.g., TinyPerson and Tiny CityPersons. Our results show that when configuring FPN with a proper fusion factor, the network is able to achieve significant performance gains over the baseline on tiny object detection datasets. Codes and models will be released."}
{"text": "In this paper we propose a novel image representation called face X-ray for detecting forgery in face images. The face X-ray of an input face image is a greyscale image that reveals whether the input image can be decomposed into the blending of two images from different sources. It does so by showing the blending boundary for a forged image and the absence of blending for a real image. We observe that most existing face manipulation methods share a common step: blending the altered face into an existing background image. For this reason, face X-ray provides an effective way for detecting forgery generated by most existing face manipulation algorithms. Face X-ray is general in the sense that it only assumes the existence of a blending step and does not rely on any knowledge of the artifacts associated with a specific face manipulation technique. Indeed, the algorithm for computing face X-ray can be trained without fake images generated by any of the state-of-the-art face manipulation methods. Extensive experiments show that face X-ray remains effective when applied to forgery generated by unseen face manipulation techniques, while most existing face forgery detection or deepfake detection algorithms experience a significant performance drop."}
{"text": "The prevalence of employing attention mechanisms has brought along concerns on the interpretability of attention distributions. Although it provides insights about how a model is operating, utilizing attention as the explanation of model predictions is still highly dubious. The community is still seeking more interpretable strategies for better identifying local active regions that contribute the most to the final decision. To improve the interpretability of existing attention models, we propose a novel Bilinear Representative Non-Parametric Attention (BR-NPA) strategy that captures the task-relevant human-interpretable information. The target model is first distilled to have higher-resolution intermediate feature maps. From which, representative features are then grouped based on local pairwise feature similarity, to produce finer-grained, more precise attention maps highlighting task-relevant parts of the input. The obtained attention maps are ranked according to the `active level' of the compound feature, which provides information regarding the important level of the highlighted regions. The proposed model can be easily adapted in a wide variety of modern deep models, where classification is involved. It is also more accurate, faster, and with a smaller memory footprint than usual neural attention modules. Extensive experiments showcase more comprehensive visual explanations compared to the state-of-the-art visualization model across multiple tasks including few-shot classification, person re-identification, fine-grained image classification. The proposed visualization model sheds imperative light on how neural networks `pay their attention' differently in different tasks."}
{"text": "We experimentally investigate a collection of feature engineering pipelines for use with a CNN for classifying eyes-open or eyes-closed from electroencephalogram (EEG) time-series from the Bonn dataset. Using the Takens' embedding--a geometric representation of time-series--we construct simplicial complexes from EEG data. We then compare \\epsilon-series of Betti-numbers and \\epsilon-series of graph spectra (a novel construction)--two topological invariants of the latent geometry from these complexes--to raw time series of the EEG to fill in a gap in the literature for benchmarking. These methods, inspired by Topological Data Analysis, are used for feature engineering to capture local geometry of the time-series. Additionally, we test these feature pipelines' robustness to downsampling and data reduction. This paper seeks to establish clearer expectations for both time-series classification via geometric features, and how CNNs for time-series respond to data of degraded resolution."}
{"text": "Cervical spondylosis (CS) is a common chronic disease that affects up to two-thirds of the population and poses a serious burden on individuals and society. The early identification has significant value in improving cure rate and reducing costs. However, the pathology is complex, and the mild symptoms increase the difficulty of the diagnosis, especially in the early stage. Besides, the time-consuming and costliness of hospital medical service reduces the attention to the CS identification. Thus, a convenient, low-cost intelligent CS identification method is imperious demanded. In this paper, we present an intelligent method based on the deep learning to identify CS, using the surface electromyography (sEMG) signal. Faced with the complex, high dimensionality and weak usability of the sEMG signal, we proposed and developed a multi-channel EasiCSDeep algorithm based on the convolutional neural network, which consists of the feature extraction, spatial relationship representation and classification algorithm. To the best of our knowledge, this EasiCSDeep is the first effort to employ the deep learning and the sEMG data to identify CS. Compared with previous state-of-the-art algorithm, our algorithm achieves a significant improvement."}
{"text": "An appealing property of the natural gradient is that it is invariant to arbitrary differentiable reparameterizations of the model. However, this invariance property requires infinitesimal steps and is lost in practical implementations with small but finite step sizes. In this paper, we study invariance properties from a combined perspective of Riemannian geometry and numerical differential equation solving. We define the order of invariance of a numerical method to be its convergence order to an invariant solution. We propose to use higher-order integrators and geodesic corrections to obtain more invariant optimization trajectories. We prove the numerical convergence properties of geodesic corrected updates and show that they can be as computationally efficient as plain natural gradient. Experimentally, we demonstrate that invariance leads to faster optimization and our techniques improve on traditional natural gradient in deep neural network training and natural policy gradient for reinforcement learning."}

Besides, these methods undervalued the short-term motion cues among adjacent frames. In this paper, we propose a Temporal Modulation Network (TMNet) to interpolate arbitrary intermediate frame(s) with accurate high-resolution reconstruction. Specifically, we propose a Temporal Modulation Block (TMB) to modulate deformable convolution kernels for controllable feature interpolation. To well exploit the temporal information, we propose a Locally-temporal Feature Comparison (LFC) module, along with the Bi-directional Deformable ConvLSTM, to extract short-term and long-term motion cues in videos. Experiments on three benchmark datasets demonstrate that our TMNet outperforms previous STVSR methods. The code is available at https://github.com/CS-GangXu/TMNet."}
{"text": "As one of standard approaches to train deep neural networks, dropout has been applied to regularize large models to avoid overfitting, and the improvement in performance by dropout has been explained as avoiding co-adaptation between nodes. However, when correlations between nodes are compared after training the networks with or without dropout, one question arises if co-adaptation avoidance explains the dropout effect completely. In this paper, we propose an additional explanation of why dropout works and propose a new technique to design better activation functions. First, we show that dropout can be explained as an optimization technique to push the input towards the saturation area of nonlinear activation function by accelerating gradient information flowing even in the saturation area in backpropagation. Based on this explanation, we propose a new technique for activation functions, , that accelerates gradients to flow even in the saturation area. Then, input to the activation function can climb onto the saturation area which makes the network more robust because the model converges on a flat region. Experiment results support our explanation of dropout and confirm that the proposed GAAF technique improves image classification performance with expected properties."}
{"text": "Deep learning has shown impressive performance on challenging perceptual tasks and has been widely used in software to provide intelligent services. However, researchers found deep neural networks vulnerable to adversarial examples. Since then, many methods are proposed to defend against adversaries in inputs, but they are either attack-dependent or shown to be ineffective with new attacks. And most of existing techniques have complicated structures or mechanisms that cause prohibitively high overhead or latency, impractical to apply on real software.   We propose DAFAR, a feedback framework that allows deep learning models to detect/purify adversarial examples in high effectiveness and universality, with low area and time overhead. DAFAR has a simple structure, containing a victim model, a plug-in feedback network, and a detector. The key idea is to import the high-level features from the victim model's feature extraction layers into the feedback network to reconstruct the input. This data stream forms a feedback autoencoder. For strong attacks, it transforms the imperceptible attack on the victim model into the obvious reconstruction-error attack on the feedback autoencoder directly, which is much easier to detect; for weak attacks, the reformation process destroys the structure of adversarial examples. Experiments are conducted on MNIST and CIFAR-10 data-sets, showing that DAFAR is effective against popular and arguably most advanced attacks without losing performance on legitimate samples, with high effectiveness and universality across attack methods and parameters."}
{"text": "We propose a method for unsupervised video object segmentation by transferring the knowledge encapsulated in image-based instance embedding networks. The instance embedding network produces an embedding vector for each pixel that enables identifying all pixels belonging to the same object. Though trained on static images, the instance embeddings are stable over consecutive video frames, which allows us to link objects together over time. Thus, we adapt the instance networks trained on static images to video object segmentation and incorporate the embeddings with objectness and optical flow features, without model retraining or online fine-tuning. The proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art unsupervised segmentation methods in the DAVIS dataset and the FBMS dataset."}
{"text": "Reward shaping is an effective technique for incorporating domain knowledge into reinforcement learning (RL). Existing approaches such as potential-based reward shaping normally make full use of a given shaping reward function. However, since the transformation of human knowledge into numeric reward values is often imperfect due to reasons such as human cognitive bias, completely utilizing the shaping reward function may fail to improve the performance of RL algorithms. In this paper, we consider the problem of adaptively utilizing a given shaping reward function. We formulate the utilization of shaping rewards as a bi-level optimization problem, where the lower level is to optimize policy using the shaping rewards and the upper level is to optimize a parameterized shaping weight function for true reward maximization. We formally derive the gradient of the expected true reward with respect to the shaping weight function parameters and accordingly propose three learning algorithms based on different assumptions. Experiments in sparse-reward cartpole and MuJoCo environments show that our algorithms can fully exploit beneficial shaping rewards, and meanwhile ignore unbeneficial shaping rewards or even transform them into beneficial ones."}
{"text": "Normalizing Flows (NFs) are able to model complicated distributions p(y) with strong inter-dimensional correlations and high multimodality by transforming a simple base density p(z) through an invertible neural network under the change of variables formula. Such behavior is desirable in multivariate structured prediction tasks, where handcrafted per-pixel loss-based methods inadequately capture strong correlations between output dimensions. We present a study of conditional normalizing flows (CNFs), a class of NFs where the base density to output space mapping is conditioned on an input x, to model conditional densities p(y|x). CNFs are efficient in sampling and inference, they can be trained with a likelihood-based objective, and CNFs, being generative flows, do not suffer from mode collapse or training instabilities. We provide an effective method to train continuous CNFs for binary problems and in particular, we apply these CNFs to super-resolution and vessel segmentation tasks demonstrating competitive performance on standard benchmark datasets in terms of likelihood and conventional metrics."}
{"text": "Many applications in robotics and human-computer interaction can benefit from understanding 3D motion of points in a dynamic environment, widely noted as scene flow. While most previous methods focus on stereo and RGB-D images as input, few try to estimate scene flow directly from point clouds. In this work, we propose a novel deep neural network named FlowNet3D that learns scene flow from point clouds in an end-to-end fashion. Our network simultaneously learns deep hierarchical features of point clouds and flow embeddings that represent point motions, supported by two newly proposed learning layers for point sets. We evaluate the network on both challenging synthetic data from FlyingThings3D and real Lidar scans from KITTI. Trained on synthetic data only, our network successfully generalizes to real scans, outperforming various baselines and showing competitive results to the prior art. We also demonstrate two applications of our scene flow output (scan registration and motion segmentation) to show its potential wide use cases."}
{"text": "Obtaining dense 3D reconstrution with low computational cost is one of the important goals in the field of SLAM. In this paper we propose a dense 3D reconstruction framework from monocular multispectral video sequences using jointly semi-dense SLAM and Multispectral Photometric Stereo approaches. Starting from multispectral video, SALM (a) reconstructs a semi-dense 3D shape that will be densified;(b) recovers relative sparse depth map that is then fed as prioris into optimization-based multispectral photometric stereo for a more accurate dense surface normal recovery;(c)obtains camera pose that is subsequently used for conversion of view in the process of fusion where we combine the relative sparse point cloud with the dense surface normal using the automated cross-scale fusion method proposed in this paper to get a dense point cloud with subtle texture information. Experiments show that our method can effectively obtain denser 3D reconstructions."}
{"text": "Generative adversarial networks (GANs) studies have grown exponentially in the past few years. Their impact has been seen mainly in the computer vision field with realistic image and video manipulation, especially generation, making significant advancements. While these computer vision advances have garnered much attention, GAN applications have diversified across disciplines such as time series and sequence generation. As a relatively new niche for GANs, fieldwork is ongoing to develop high quality, diverse and private time series data. In this paper, we review GAN variants designed for time series related applications. We propose a taxonomy of discrete-variant GANs and continuous-variant GANs, in which GANs deal with discrete time series and continuous time series data. Here we showcase the latest and most popular literature in this field; their architectures, results, and applications. We also provide a list of the most popular evaluation metrics and their suitability across applications. Also presented is a discussion of privacy measures for these GANs and further protections and directions for dealing with sensitive data. We aim to frame clearly and concisely the latest and state-of-the-art research in this area and their applications to real-world technologies."}
{"text": "Monocular 3D object detection is an important task for autonomous driving considering its advantage of low cost. It is much more challenging than conventional 2D cases due to its inherent ill-posed property, which is mainly reflected in the lack of depth information. Recent progress on 2D detection offers opportunities to better solving this problem. However, it is non-trivial to make a general adapted 2D detector work in this 3D task. In this paper, we study this problem with a practice built on a fully convolutional single-stage detector and propose a general framework FCOS3D. Specifically, we first transform the commonly defined 7-DoF 3D targets to the image domain and decouple them as 2D and 3D attributes. Then the objects are distributed to different feature levels with consideration of their 2D scales and assigned only according to the projected 3D-center for the training procedure. Furthermore, the center-ness is redefined with a 2D Gaussian distribution based on the 3D-center to fit the 3D target formulation. All of these make this framework simple yet effective, getting rid of any 2D detection or 2D-3D correspondence priors. Our solution achieves 1st place out of all the vision-only methods in the nuScenes 3D detection challenge of NeurIPS 2020. Code and models are released at https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmdetection3d."}
{"text": "Video feedback provides a wealth of information about surgical procedures and is the main sensory cue for surgeons. Scene understanding is crucial to computer assisted interventions (CAI) and to post-operative analysis of the surgical procedure. A fundamental building block of such capabilities is the identification and localization of surgical instruments and anatomical structures through semantic segmentation. Deep learning has advanced semantic segmentation techniques in the recent years but is inherently reliant on the availability of labeled datasets for model training. This paper introduces a dataset for semantic segmentation of cataract surgery videos. The annotated images are part of the publicly available CATARACTS challenge dataset. In addition, we benchmark the performance of several state-of-the-art deep learning models for semantic segmentation on the presented dataset. The dataset is publicly available at https://cataracts.grand-challenge.org/CaDIS/ ."}
{"text": "Teaching plays a very important role in our society, by spreading human knowledge and educating our next generations. A good teacher will select appropriate teaching materials, impact suitable methodologies, and set up targeted examinations, according to the learning behaviors of the students. In the field of artificial intelligence, however, one has not fully explored the role of teaching, and pays most attention to machine . In this paper, we argue that equal attention, if not more, should be paid to teaching, and furthermore, an optimization framework (instead of heuristics) should be used to obtain good teaching strategies. We call this approach `learning to teach'. In the approach, two intelligent agents interact with each other: a student model (which corresponds to the learner in traditional machine learning algorithms), and a teacher model (which determines the appropriate data, loss function, and hypothesis space to facilitate the training of the student model). The teacher model leverages the feedback from the student model to optimize its own teaching strategies by means of reinforcement learning, so as to achieve teacher-student co-evolution. To demonstrate the practical value of our proposed approach, we take the training of deep neural networks (DNN) as an example, and show that by using the learning to teach techniques, we are able to use much less training data and fewer iterations to achieve almost the same accuracy for different kinds of DNN models (e.g., multi-layer perceptron, convolutional neural networks and recurrent neural networks) under various machine learning tasks (e.g., image classification and text understanding)."}
{"text": "Despite the recent successes of reinforcement learning in games and robotics, it is yet to become broadly practical. Sample efficiency and unreliable performance in rare but challenging scenarios are two of the major obstacles. Drawing inspiration from the effectiveness of deliberate practice for achieving expert-level human performance, we propose a new adversarial sampling approach guided by a failure predictor named \"CoachNet\". CoachNet is trained online along with the agent to predict the probability of failure. This probability is then used in a stochastic sampling process to guide the agent to more challenging episodes. This way, instead of wasting time on scenarios that the agent has already mastered, training is focused on the agent's \"weak spots\". We present the design of CoachNet, explain its underlying principles, and empirically demonstrate its effectiveness in improving sample efficiency and test-time robustness in common continuous control tasks."}
